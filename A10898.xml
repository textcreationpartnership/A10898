            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One is, That intereſt of love and reſpect, which a long time (not my ſelfe alone) but ſundry of our name and Tribe have received from your Ladiſhip. Another is, your loving acceptance of ſuch former ſervice of mine to God and his Church in this kinde, as hath privately come to your hands: wherein you have ingenuouſly profeſſed your ſelfe to be a daily travailer with ſome fruit. Likewiſe that honourable eſteeme which I have ever
<pb facs="tcp:12335:3"/> borne and beare to the memory of that noble and worthy Knight your deceaſed husband, was not a little moment in my thoughts: Not to ſpeake of my acquaintance with ſome of your religious Race, of whom I ſay the leſſe, as perſwaded that they ſeeke the praiſe of God, not of man. Beſides all theſe, I adde this: That my hope is, that from your patronage and protection, ſome of your owne ranke, and more of your inferiours, (who looke after bookes as much for the grace and allowance of their betters, as for the worth of their matter) might by reading thereof, be drawne to love them for the true good which they have gained thereby.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt not deny, but there is a greater motive than all theſe: Seldome have I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly converſed with your Ladiſhip at any time, but I have obſerved ſome carefulneſſe in you to be ſetled upon ſome good evidences which might ſecure you of pardon, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God. A ſolemne object! I confeſſe; the very thought whereof as you may bleſſe God for, ſo much more you ſhal have cauſe to prayſe him, in vouchſafing you! Which ſhall come to paſſe, if (as alway, ſo) eſpecially in
<pb facs="tcp:12335:3"/> this laſt act of your life, you ſhall give all diligence by reading, meditation, and prayer, to make it ſure to your owne ſoule. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire therefore being, that I might conferre ſomewhat hereto; and ſithence God hath caſt your eye and affection upon my labours, (which doe cheefely ayme at this marke) I beſeech the Lord ſo to guide your ſpirit in your peruſall thereof; That (whatſoever you paſſe over beſides) you may take ſpeciall marke of thoſe grounds of Humiliation, ſelfe-denyall, and faith, which moſt concerne the maine point of aſſurance. Neglecting no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, if by any meanes you may atteine to the reſurrection of the dead, and the whilſt may be ſatisfied with peace and joy through beleeving. That ſo, your heart daily grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more tender, and confident upon the bare word of the promiſe (you neede no other ſupport) your whole heart and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may be moulded into a new creature, according to the meaſure of mercy!</p>
                  <p>I will not delay you with diſcourſe about the contents of the enſuing treatiſe; that were but to prevent both the Epiſtle following, and the Booke it ſelfe. As touching helpes for your
<pb facs="tcp:12335:4"/> comfortable receiving (which I have noted you to ſpeake ſeriouſly of) I cannot doubt but your Ladiſhip hath many, (though I know not any who have travailed in this kind with me, to unite the full doctrine and practiſe of the ſupper in one.) But for as much as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoovefull upon ſuch occaſions, not onely to heare in publique, but alſo to have ſome reall ſubject at hand which may preſent the Truth to a deſirous heart, and releeve memory; therefore I doubt not but this Treatiſe may ad a furtherance thereto. If, as the Lord hath with much labour &amp; 6. or 7. yeares, thoughts (at times) now brought this poore fruite to the light, ſo he pleaſe to adde a ſutable ſucceſſe unto it, in his peoples practiſe: I ſhall have no cauſe to repent me. It is the Lord, who as hee is tyed to none of our tongues or pens, ſo yet hath bound himſelfe to our faith, prayers and diligence. To whom therefore commending the iſſue of your Ladiſhips endeavours here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, together with the proſperity of your ſelfe and yours, an happy end of your long pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and peace to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I reſt</p>

And ſithence our good God hath not contented himſelfe to vouchſafe to his Church this great gift of Chriſt, onely by the word of promiſe: (which yet, being grounded upon ſuch unſhaken Foundations, as his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, the death of his Son, and the faithfulneſſe of his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, might well claime the obedience and conſent of faith at our hands) But alſo hath added the Sacraments as ſeales of this his covenant, and as the utmoſt aſsurance of his good meaning; moreouer annexing the Spirit of promiſe and of ſeale, to them both, for the better applying to each ſoule in particular, his part in theſe good things which he hath betea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her: I have thought it fitteſt (having now leaſure more than enough to chuſe my argument) to light upon this, of Chriſt Sacramentall: as giving mee hope of doing the moſt

                  <p>Every man deſires to have that which he buyeth or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when the commodity is at the beſt: When men would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew or buy wares or cattle in the Market, they deſire to ſet them forth at the beſt; and when they are in beſt caſe to attract buyers: we love to behold the faces of them we love, when they are at the beſt, for health of body and ſpirit: and if we were as wiſe to improove every thing to the beſt, as we are willing to get it at the beſt; ſure it is, we love to get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the worſt, which may bee come by at the best. Now then the Sacraments exhibite Chriſt (as I may ſay) at his beſt: And as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> daughter is invited to come &amp; behold <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> when he was clothed with all thoſe coſtly ornaments and glory where with his mother made him glad on his crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninng day; ſo doe the Sacraments offer Chriſt a greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect than <hi>Salomon</hi> even in his best Grace, in the richeſt and royalleſt robe of his righteouſneſſe, in the beſt of his Peace, ioy, and contentation which God can beſtow him in; Whoſe heart ſhould not then eſteeme him at this beſt of his, with beſt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affection? Not by fooliſh or Popiſh compariſon of one ordinance with another; But by conſidering that each ordinance with another is better than another alone, and ſo the Sacrament with a word, is above the word alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it containes the word and hath more beſides in it, even Chriſt at his beſt, in the fulneſſe, length, depth, and all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of breeding and nouriſhing grace, not onely in himſelfe, but made over to my ſoule by the Father, grace for grace to mee: my Wiſedome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p>Alas! deere friends! What were the knowledge of this Lord Ieſus, as he is only the ſecond perſon in Trinity and the
<pb facs="tcp:12335:5"/> eternall Word of the Father? If the depth of that myſtery contained in <hi>Heb. 1:3.</hi> (To wit, that Chriſt is the brightnes of the Fathers glory, and the ingraven forme of his perſon) were fully underſtood by a man, (as who doubts but ſuch knowledge were excellent?) yet alas! it falls ſhort of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Phil. 3:</hi> Of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord, who hath given himſelfe for me, loved me, by which the world is crucified to me, and I to it; this onely is that to which all other is dung and droſſe. Nay further, put caſe I knew him, as the true Mediator, in all three offices, and namely the true onely Prieſt and ſatisfier for the ſinnes of the world: Were this that excellent knowledge of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except he were crucified alſo in the eye and to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gaine of my ſoule, as my Lord and God, and as my ſatisfaction, and the treader of the wine-preſſe of the fierce wrath of God, <hi>Eſay 63.1,</hi> that the anger of God might be pacified to me? No verily. Nay laſtly, put caſe this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ieſus Chriſt my ſatisfier, could poſsibly bee ſevered from the knowledge of him my Sanctifier alſo: and that Chriſt my birth, could bee divided from Chriſt my Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; my ſupport, health, growth, and fruitfulneſſe; could this knowledge be counted the moſt excellent? Were it not a rending (rather) of one peece of Chriſts garment from another, yea a pulling of one eſpeciall part of him from my ſoule, and breaking of ſo precious a Diamond in peices? What excellent things then muſt thoſe be, which preſent the Lord Ieſus in all theſe three, the beauty of his perſon, the benefit of his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and the grace of his Sanctification; and that to mee, with ſeazin and delivery? That offer him (as I ſayd) at his beſt? This doe the Sacraments, and therefore of how great eſteeme ſhould they be in the Church of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe if I preſented Chriſt to thy view (good Reader) in thoſe darke Sacraments of the Old Teſtament, or no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:12335:6"/> than <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt could, I ſhould bring thee a burgaine at the worſt hand. For, although Chriſt were in them alſo, yet with ſuch poore convincement, that I may ſafely ſay: The body of receivers, who beheld the covenant of the Law as a covenant of workes and Righteouſneſſe thereby; did receive the Sacraments as a curſe rather than a bleſsing upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and bred worſe blood in themſelves thereby, than before they had. For why? They renouncing the right co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of righteouſneſſe whereof they were ſeales, (as it is ſayd, that <hi>Abraham</hi> received circumciſion as a ſeale of it) and miſtaking the law, as if it required a poſsible obedience from them, to merit life; what did they but curſe themſelves and ſay, Curſed be he who thinkes he can abide in all things written in the booke of the Law to doe them? And not being able to doe them, but deluding themſelves, and taking the Sacrament upon it; what did they in effect, but ſeale up that curſe to themſelves and their ſeede? But lo, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Ghoſpell, is offered thee a better miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirit of the Lord Ieſus, in the ſeales of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which comes by faith: and therefore a curſe is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a bleſsing. For as the covenant is, which thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt in, ſo is the ſeale which thou receivest, both are bleſſed, and thou comming in faith unto them, receiveſt from God bleſsing under ſeale: ſo that hee hath bleſſed thee, and thou ſhalt bee bleſſed. And is not this the Lord Ieſus at his beſt?</p>
                  <p>Moreover if I preſented thee onely Iewiſh Sacraments, what great thing ſhould I offer thee? Surely Chriſt in a darke corner, circumciſion in a private family, the Paſſeover in an houſhold by it ſelfe: But lo, I preſent Chriſt unto thee not with a veile before his face, which is obſcure: but in a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, with open face, transforming thee from glory to glory. I ſay a Chriſt Sacramentall, not offered by a Priest to God in a
<pb facs="tcp:12335:6"/> Maſſe, and in a corner of the Church, with a boy to mumble an anſwere, but in the open view of his Church and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his Saints. Looke not heere for Popiſh, Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Browniſticall or Sciſmaticall Sacraments huddled up by a falſe Church in their houſes, barnes, or corners, (though I taxe not corners where the Church is preſent as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres were in woods: but in the midſt of his people, where Chriſt the Lord of Sacraments is preſent with his owne, met in his name, even in the beauty of his holineſſe. So that as he ſuffered not in a corner of heaven, or earth, but upon an hill before his Church, and refuſed not the world to bee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and was lift up as the Serpent in the wildernes, in the publike view of his people; ſo, that thou profeſſeſt to bee a dove of his flocke, and one of the youth of his wombe, <hi>Pſal. 110.</hi> Mayst fly to his loover and windowes, and come into his Temple with frequency as the dew falls upon the graſſe, ſaying, How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of hoſts! My fleſh longeth and my feete deſire to ſee and ſtand in the courts of thine houſe. Even in the chambers of my Mother! and in the Garden of thy ſpices, even there give me thy love: There let thy Northwind of Prayer and bleſsing blow thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour into my noſtrills, that after thine ointments powred out there, the Daughters my followthe! And is not this, Chriſt at the beſt?</p>
                  <p>But to proceed a little in this argument (for I have locked my ſelfe out of the hall, &amp; therefore muſt ſtand a while in my porch rather than no where) what better proofe of the Lord Ieſus at his beſt, than this, that he is offered to thee in no leſſe myſticall union for the end of a more myſticall one? I meane as united to poore bread and wine, that he might alſo unite himſelfe in the whole grace of his Sacrifice to thy ſoule and body? What better und eaſier conveiance couldſt thou wiſh than this, for ſo feeble and weake a ſpirit as thine is? When
<pb facs="tcp:12335:7"/> once that people which followed Chriſt ſitting upon an Aſſe Colt, and riding as a King to Ieruſalem, cryed Hoſanna, and ſayd, Bleſſed be he that commeth in the name of the Lord: Thinke we not that they ſaw Chriſt at the beſt? Why did they elſe, (except they had beheld his ſpiritual Kingdome) cut downe Palmes and ſtrew them in the way, ſtripping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their garments to ſet him thereon? Surely they were not ſo offended at the meaneneſſe of his palfrey and baſeneſſe of the outſide, but they ſaw in this his riding, a cleere repreſentation of his glorious grace, and the Maieſty of his perſon. So ſhouldſt thou, in this union of Chriſt with baſe crummes of bread or drops of wine, behold a more ſpirituall preſence of Chriſt, who careth not for ſuch creatures, but for thy ſoule; and being farre from ſtumbling at the baſeneſſe of the Aſſe, or Elements, raiſe up thy ſoule to a more heavenly ſenſe, of the Lord Ieſus comming into thy heart and ſpirit, bringing thee to God, and uniting thee to the fountaine of thy bleſſedneſſe in a farre cloſer manner than ever <hi>Adam</hi> was. And is not this union, the Lord Ieſus at his beſt? yes verily.</p>
                  <p>From this Sacramentall union, proceeds that exhibitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sacraments, carrying the Lord Ieſus into the ſoule of all the elect that communicate. For to what end is union Sacramentall, ſave that the Sacraments being thus poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the Lord Ieſus mystically in them, might exhibite to all, and effectually carry into the boſomes of the elect, the power of this Lord Ieſus, and convey as Veſſells, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles and Pipes, that grace which they containe? I doe not meane that by vertue of the worke wrought, or by the force of Divine inſtitution, there is any naturall holineſſe put into them, or magicall power of inchantment, to take hold of the ſoule. No, in no wiſe: for how many thouſands are there both young and old, who after the enjoying of
<pb facs="tcp:12335:7"/> the Sacraments, doe put moſt woefull barres in their owne way, that the power of Sacramentall union might never come at them? So that when the Covenant comes to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenced unto them, they fare as perſons utterly diſabled to receive it. Nay, neither dare I thinke that by vertue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, its of abſolute neceſsity that all Elect Infants muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive converſion of grace, juſt in the act of their Baptizing: for what were this but to aſcribe more to the Seale than to the Covenant, yea to invert their order, and to aſcribe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power to an ordinance, (under which they walke <hi>20, 30, 40.</hi> yeeres careleſly, without diſcovery of any grace at all) rather than to the lively power of the Covenant preached and working from that time forth, an apparant change? So that although in charity I am bound to thinke no other, ſave that all ſuch as receive Sacraments duely, concurre with the grace of the Spirit for future improvement: Yet to tye the Lords hands behind him, and to make the Lord of Sacraments to become their underling, as if hee had put himſelfe out of Authority and office, wholly to be ſubject to his Sacrament, what indignity were it for the ordainer? No not ſo: But ſo farre, ſo often, and where it ſhall ſeeme good to himſelfe to make uſe of his Sacrament for the good of his Elect (for whoſe good they ſerve) there doubtleſſe theſe Ordinances doe both preſent and conferre the grace which is put into them? Elſe to what end ſhould they have it, except they might convey it? Now ſumme up all, and anſwere: Is not the exhibitive power of the Sacrament, the Lord Ieſus at his beſt? Is not a reall tender, better than a bare ſigne, or a promiſe onely without performance? He that promiſeth an hundred pounds to lend or give to his poore friend, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tenders the money, that he might be before hand, doth he not lend or give at the beſt?</p>
                  <p>Nay, more than this, not the Sacraments onely are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive of Chriſt to the ſoule: But by vertue of the union I
<pb facs="tcp:12335:8"/> have ſpoken of, the Lord Ieſus himſelfe is there preſent (where his inſtitution is duely obſerved) to be the Baptizer of his members, and to be the ſteward and nouriſher of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: that is, to beſtow himſelfe upon the ſoule. Touching Baptiſme firſt, true it is, That our Lord Ieſus himſelfe never baptiſed any outwardly: howbeit as then, ſo much more now being aſcended, he it is who in the outward Baptiſme of the Miniſter, doth give gifts unto men, and doth ſtill baptiſe all his, with the holy Ghoſt and fire. A poore ſinfull man doth what he can doe; but further he cannot goe: He dives the infant into, holdes it in, and receives it out againe from the water, baptiſing it in the name of the ſacred Trinity. But this our great Baptiſt, he is all in all for the doing of the worke. It is he who caſts in the ſalt of his divine healing power into corrupt and (of themſelves) accurſed creatures; and Element; and element; he removes the curſe, death and barrennes of the waters, utterly unable to engender; he takes off their baſe uncomelineſſe: he darts and plants in them the efficacy of his owne death and reſurrection both for merit of pardon, and of holines: he ſanctifies &amp; clenſes them, that they may become hallowed and purging inſtruments; And as a planter takes the ſien of the Apple-tree, and pitches it into a Crabtree ſtock: ſo the Lord Ieſus takes the pretious ſien of his owne Righteouſneſse, the Power of his owne death and grave, the ſtrength of his reſurrection and exalting, and pitches both into water: ſo that water becomes Chriſt-water, Chriſts death and life, ſo that the ſoule is waſht with the one as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the other; The ſoule (by faith in the covenant) feele her deſcent into the water, to become a ſpirit of diving her into the laver, and blood, and grave of the Lord Ieſus: her being under the water, to become the ſpirit brooding and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the water, to become a ſeede of life abiding in the wombe of the ſoule, to regenerate it to the life of Chriſt; Her ariſing up from the water, to become a ſpirit of Reſurrection
<pb facs="tcp:12335:8"/> (as <hi>Peter</hi> excellently ſpeakes <hi>1</hi> Epiſt. cap. <hi>3.</hi> verſe <hi>21.</hi>) and a baptiſing of the ſoule with the activity and raiſing of her up with Chriſt, from her death, grave, baſeneſſe and miſery, unto immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and glory. Yea in all three the ſoule feeles the power of a new and omnipotent creation of her to God, ingrafting her in God, never to be pulled from him any more as at firſt. And as the ſpirit whereby the Lord offered up himſelfe was, ſo is the power of the ſame ſpirit to the ſoule, begetting and renewing it; Eternall alſo: ſo that the never dying power of baptiſme keepes the branch of the vine thus one put in, to abide for ever ingrafted and planted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perſon of <hi>Emanuell:</hi> ſo that himſelfe the ſtocke ſhall as ſoone wither, as the ſoule which by faith is in him ſhall periſh. No more baptiſings ſhall neede than one, becauſe Christ ever liveth in the ſoule, and recovereth her by his unreſtrained influence, from all her ſwouning, decayes and wanzings, to her former integrity: no more Barkes are required after ſhipwracke ſave this one. Now, if Chriſt himſelfe in perſon (not the poore Miniſter with all his acts onely) be the true Baptiſt: can it be otherwiſe, but Baptiſme muſt needes be the Lord Ieſus at the beſt?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to adde one word alſo of the Supper: The ſinfull tongue and hands (I ſay not of a wicked Maſſe Prieſt) but even the beſt conſecrater of the Sacrament, that lives, cannot bleſſe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But the Lord Ieſus our ſteward, he is the Adminiſter of it completely; he is the true conſecrater, yea the foode and feeder of the Soules of his owne, with his pretious body and blood unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. None whom the Father hath given him to be his living ones, can decay, pine, or wither under his hand while he lives to make them Proviſion. He told his Deſciples, he would eate and drinke no more of the fruite of the Vine, till hee dranke it in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: meaning, till he ſpiritually without mouth or hands, did preſent himſelfe with his Church Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>amentally, there to feede them: But in that ſence he promiſed to drinke it with them, to the worlds end He it is then who as the Maſter of the feaſt and the feaſt alſo, welcometh, provideth for, and encourageth his gueſts, to
<pb facs="tcp:12335:9"/> eate good things, and to delight in fatneſſe: He it is who not onely in the Miniſters perſon ſtill conſecrateth, but by his might and ſtrength, derives all his blood, ſpirit, marrow and nouriſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bones and veines of his poore members, by his union with the elements; whereby he ſaveth and ſuſtayneth all his true borne ones that cry after his breſt and ſuccour; he cannot ſuffer them to lacke. And as himſelfe in divers phraſes expreſſeth, he feedes them in his Paſtures, leades them to the waters, he cheriſheth them as his ſpouſe, nouriſheth them as his branches, and by him as the doore, they goe in and out, finding paſture. For he hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe one with bread and wine, that man not living by bread onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God: may, in and by theſe Elements, draw a ſecret foyſon and increaſe to the ſoule, and be therein ſuſteined with faith and the fruits, as after in the Treatiſe (God willing) I ſhall more fully declare. He whoſe fleſh once eaten is immortall, yet offers himſelfe often for the releefe of daily defects. And is not this the Lord Ieſus at his beſt in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alſo?</p>
                  <p>Endleſſe it were to recite all which might convince thee of this excellency of Chriſt Sacramentall. Who would not confeſſe that friend to ſhew his love at the beſt, who ſhould moſt draw neare to him in his greateſt troubles? And is not Chriſt Sacramentall for the nonce? To what end then doth he offer thee his blood and bid th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Againe, if a man ſhould promiſe to doe thee a kindneſſe, wouldſt thou not interpret his kindneſſe at the beſt, if it lay in ſuch a kind, as ſhould ſupply thy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar want? What kindneſſe is counted of, like that which is moſt ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſonable? That which releeves not ſome defect, may be thought ſuperfluous. Even ſo is Chriſt Sacramentall: a releefe of each ſoules perſonall, peculiar diſeaſes, wants, decayes, diſtempers. Like to the man of <hi>Baalſhaliſha, 2</hi> King. <hi>4.42.</hi> who brought loaves of Corne and preſents to the Prophet, when there was a neceſsity of famine,
<pb facs="tcp:12335:9"/> and a multitude to bee fed. But I end in a word: Wherein can it more cleerely appeare that the Lord Ieſus is offered thee in the Sacrament at his beſt, than in his bleſſed fulneſſe? If thou ſhouldeſt viſite thy friends houſe, tell mee when ſhouldſt thou moſt thinke thou cameſt at the beſt, than in the middeſt of a feaſt? So I ſay heere, The Sacrament is the Kings feaſt at the marriage of his Sonne: The feaſt of the hills, the feaſt of God, and heaven a full feaſt of all refined wines, fat and delicate things. If Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie be ſo good, is not his feaſt of Chriſt, Chriſt at his beſt? Wherein thy ſoule may fill it ſelfe for the preſent and for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with choice Deinties, as the Aramites campe, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof filled the leapers.</p>
                  <p>But, now what is the upſhot of all? Oh! ſad mourning! That we are at our worſt when Chriſt is beſt! Oh mourne that after <hi>70.</hi> yeeres liberty of the word and Sacraments in the Church: yet by the ſinne of man, ſuch myſteries as theſe ſhould lye by, diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, becauſe unacknowledged? True it is, as once it was a deepe conceit with the Iew, that his Meſsia must neede be ſome ſpeciall perſon: But when the true Meſsia indeed came, they knew not what to make of him; he was a ſtrange wonder unto them. So now, it deepely dwells in most men, that in the Sacrament ſome myſticall thing lyes hidden: but when they come to it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they know not what: The cauſe is, their carnality, and ſenſualneſſe, which is offended at the ſpiritualneſſe of them: which makes them alleadge, oh they are darke matters, and for great Divines, not for ſuch as they, to meddle withall. And thus in time, corrupt eaſe breeding error: that errour growes to proove religion: and as at firſt men thought them difficult, ſo at length its their beſt devotion, to reſt in blind and ſuperstitious reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a thing unknowne. As thoſe Athenians, who ſet up an Altar, to the unknowable God blind devotion being the meere fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhort of faith. If this diſeaſe had infected popery onely, it had beene well: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> this Popiſh leaven of carnall Sacraments which ſowred the firſt reformation with a conſubſtantiate Chriſt: hath tainted us with as dangerous an error, even to reſt in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall devotion, and the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of a devout blinde recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, counting it the top of religion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12335:10"/>
                  <p>Alas! poore ſoules. To what purpoſe doe we ſo crake and boaſt of our Sacraments of the Goſpel, that they are above thoſe of the old Teſtament in al reſpects (as indeede thy are) when as its cleare by good experience, that ſetting aſide ſome places enlightned by the word, our Sacraments to the body of our people, are as dimme and dumbe repreſenters of a Chriſt already crucified, as to the Iew, they were darke pretendings of the Meſsiah to come. Oh! How woefull a fruit of darkeneſſe is this, that people now in this midday of light, are ſo bafled, that it fares with them as if it were twylight? Is it not fearefull, that when there is ſo great odds in the ſeaſon, there ſhould be ſo little in the perſons living in them! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe blindnes makes all ſeaſons alike, both of darknes and light? How fearefull is it that our eye ſhould be ſo evill to our ſelves when Gods is ſo good? &amp; that we ſhould be ſuch Almners of Gods bounty to our ſelves as if we ſtill ſerved an hard Maſter, what is this but to betray God to the blaſphemy of Hypocrites, profane ones, and ignorants?</p>
                  <p>This little underſtanding of theſe myſteries, among men in this age of ours (wherein mens frequency of receiving ſeemes to ſtrive with their unfruitfulneſſe) hath beene one occaſion of my publiſhing this treatiſe. That (if poſsible) that exceſsive exalting of the Sacraments in Popery, above the word or any other peece of worſhip, through their Superſtition: might bee equalled among us Proteſtants in the Church of God, with as truely honourable an eſteeme thereof, and that from knowledge and experience of their worth. Conſidering partly the little care of teaching their doctrine in Congregations: and partly the cold preparation of ſuch as receive; and partly the reſting of men in their performances onely without power or fruit: I could not ſee wherein I ſhould doe greater honour to God than to enhanſe the knowledg of Chriſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall, &amp; to incite others to do it, whoſe learned and habituous abilities can farre better performe it? And ſurely it ſtands us all in hand, leaſt ſignes of contradiction deface) to our uttermoſt to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the excellency of our Sacraments. That thoſe rich legacies which the ſin of man, or that man of ſin, with his Complices have ſo long kept hid from the true heires and owners thereof, may be
<pb facs="tcp:12335:10"/> cleared unto them, to be their juſt portion and claime. Beſeeching the Lord, that as he ſhall vouchſafe us clearer light of knowledge, ſo (as our Church Liturgy commands us to pray) that ancient Diſcipline of Gods houſe might prevaile among us! I meane, That whereas the number of ignorant ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and unprepared ones, as much exceeds the number of prepared, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and worthy Communicants, as the army of the Aramites exceeded the Iſraelites two flockes of Kiddes: by this meanes, it might pleaſe God, the number of the latter might as much exceede the former.</p>
                  <p>For my owne part, (to returne to my matter) I bleſſe God, that while it was my lot to have a nayle in the Prieſts Sanctuary; next to the preaching of Chriſt in the promiſe, it was my poore care and courſe both by Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and Sermons, to diſcover him in his Sacraments. Which labour (as weake as it was) I have ſo little cauſe to repent of: that now I am encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in my ſelfe to recollect and compile thoſe ſcattered meditations into ſome method and view, for the benefit of others, that heard them not. A great motive whereto was alſo this, that as while they were preached, they found full as much approbation, as any part elſe of my labours: ſo, ſince; they have provoked the deſires of many more than I can mention, that they might not with my ſelfe lye by, and be buried in forgetfulneſſe. Adde heereto, that now in this vacancy of better ſervice, I could not eaſily quit my ſelfe of that idle unfruitfulneſſe which too ſoone (as ruſt) is ready to grow upon us without ſome ſervice done in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>To you then I addreſſe my ſpeech, in the concluſion, deare friends who have beene taught by, and now are made partakers of my labours: Beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, and the Lord for you, that by the lively reſemblance of theſe things which you have bin long moulded in, and ſhall be heere preſented withall; you would give Teſtimony to this Truth, as the Truth is in Ieſus. That is, that by your ſpirituall proſpering in the grace of the Lord Ieſus Sacramentall, yee would commend this Doctrine of the Sacraments, eſpecially of the Supper.

Oh how ſhall you then ſafeguard me not from the evill tongues of men (which I feare not) but the contradiction of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and the foule aſperſion of an unprofitable Miniſter of Chriſt?

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, I could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe thee of ſome cautions in the method and manner of thy reading of theſe Treatiſes: and here I would frame my ſpeech to two ſorts; the one weaker and more ignorant; the other ſuch as would think themſelves more judicious. To the former I ſay this: Firſt, that whereas weake ones lighting upon a booke of this nature, cloven in two and divided; are ready to enquire whether part is more neceſſary, and as they fancy, ſo to take what they liſt, and leave what they pleaſe; falling upon that part which they thinke neerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joyned with practiſe, paſſing by the other as leſſe needfull. Therefore I adviſe all ſuch to uſe a better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their reading, and (as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſervants did in the ſearch of the ſackes,) to begin with the eldeſt and firſt, and to end with the laſt; to reade in order, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mer Part, to the end of the latter: by which meanes it ſhall come to paſſe, that underſtanding their grounds diſtinctly and wiſely, they ſhall proceede
<pb facs="tcp:12335:12"/> to practiſe with farre greater light and ſavour, than otherwiſe they ſhould do by their confuſed reading. I obſerve alſo another folly in weake ones: That when the occaſion of the Sacrament is offered, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catch up ſome booke of that Argument, and while the pang laſteth, ſpend their devotion upon it, till they be weary; but no whit bend themſelves to reade thoſe things which chiefly concerne them: and although they ſhould light upon ſome ſuch point, yet the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being coherent, and they very unſetled, can ſcarſe reade over halfe one point: Therefore my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell to ſuch is, To turne their ſudden pangs into an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary habit; that is, to devote themſelves to a diligent reading and coherent peruſall of the things, as they are handled, without ſlightneſſe and needleſſe interruption; whereby they ſhall both meete with ſuch things as doe moſt concerne their eſtate, and ſhall be able (by taking note thereof) to turne to them at their neede, and not to be to ſeeke of them, nor wander in their reading at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties; which will cauſe their reading to be ſweete, when they feele gaine to enſue thereby.</p>
                  <p>The latter caution to the more judicious is this, That whereas ſome of them affecting to be thought ſo, when they meete with a booke of this nature, partly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contemplation, partly practiſe: Theſe (I ſay) are in another extreame, and thinking the latter to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their curious braines, do quite paſſe it over, and if they thinke to get ſome new point, of deeper nature than ordinary, or ſome diſtinction formerly unknowne to them, out of the contemplative diſcourſe; that they will faſten upon and ſtudy hard: labouring indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pride themſelves with oſtentation of ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
<pb facs="tcp:12335:12"/> or depths, than to edifie themſelves with any practicall and ſavory truthes, as they are in Ieſus. To theſe I ſay this: That although I have beene willing to handle the Theory of this point of a Sacrament, (both becauſe its little looked after, and alſo for ſatisfaction of ſober deſires of knowledge;) yet my cheefe ſcope was, rather to draw men to love and embrace the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for their true gaine and ſpirituall commodity, than to humour any frothy braine in meere diſcourſe, to puffe men up withall. In a word, if the well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reader ſhall purchaſe any thing towards more ſound underſtanding, by theſe my Collections, I ſhall be glad; but much more glad, if I ſhould finde, that this knowledge of theirs, did drop as dew, and ſoake into their hearts and affections, to ſeaſon them with a pious and conſcionable regard of the Sacraments, a more due reverence in preparing themſelves to the Table of the Lord, and a more carefull ſurvey of themſelves after their Receiving, that ſo their whole courſe might bee much better, and their former errors rectified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the ſcope of this latter part; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that looke what in my former preface and Treatiſe, I have endeavored, for opening the Doctrine; that I deſire to do in this part, for the ſtirring up of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in men, in due preparing themſelves, and meete receiving of the Supper. And ſeeing it is ſo holy, ſolemne, and hazardous a worke, it imports us to looke well to our ſelves in our partaking thereof. Sacraments (my brethren) are no morrall acts, ſuch as the managing of our earthly affaires, buyings, ſellings, companies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and callings are (which yet are holily to bee
<pb facs="tcp:12335:13"/> performed) but holy things in their nature, eminently ſpirituall and religious in themſelves. They containe Chriſt Ieſus for the ſealing up of birth and proſperity of the ſoule. As the grace is exceeding ſpirituall, which they exhibit to beleevers: ſo is the curſe as poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which they threaten to the abuſers. In no one thing doe wee either more aboundantly advantage; nor in any one more endamage our ſelves, as wee goe to worke. Spirituall ordinances are both ſpiritually vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and ſpiritually puniſhed. Hoping that this ſhort item, through mercy ſhall prevaile as much as a longer with the wiſe, and craving grace from heaven upon us both, I bid thee farewell.</p>

The Heathens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it to ſignifie a ſacred and holy ſervice about theis Idoll worſhip, and eſpecially to an oath, which they honoured as a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12335:14"/> ſacred and divine band. the Latine Fathers, eſpecially the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenteſt, <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> uſe it in the ſame ſence for an holy religious complement or performance: in which ſence (although eſpecially they aymed at our two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments) yet they alſo called any other as well by this name, as if wee would call the myſtery or doctrine of Chriſt, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; or the Church liturgy a Sacrament, or any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or private ordinance, a Sermon, a faſt, or the like. This we ſee was a very large and generall expreſſion,<note place="margin">The abuſe of it.</note> which ſome moderne Divines following without due judgement uſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found divine myſteries and Sacraments, calling each ſigne or type a Sacrament, and conſequently grant that errour, which the Fathers upon due deliberation would have diſclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>viz.</hi> that the old Church had more Sacraments than wee. Yea hereby the latine vulgar Tranſlation of the Bible (falſely called <hi>Ieromes,</hi> and magnified by Papiſts) uſurpes liberty to abuſe the Text: and though not alwayes, yet for the moſt part the Tranſlator when hee meets with the word [Myſtery] there he thinkes he hath found a Sacrament, as in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.2. and firſt of <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. the laſt verſe, in all which he tranſlats Myſtery by Sacrament. And that ſo corruptly, that even things not ſacred for ſpiritualneſſe, but onely for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, are called by him Sacraments. By which reaſon, the inveſtiture of a King, and his annointing or coronation, might be a Sacrament: which yet is a civill performance, although ſacred for the ordeyning. For a thing may retaine his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature ſtill, although it receive a marke of ſacredneſſe for prevention of corrupt abuſe and violation. And thus (in part) crept in that multitude of Popiſh Sacraments into the Church. Whereas if men had not beene thus laſcivious and bold in uſing words of their owne invention, generall words for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar meanings, much corruption about Sacraments had beene prevented. <label type="milestone">

And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.2.3.4.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3.</note> he tells the Iewes that thoſe in the Wilderneſſe had the ſame Sacraments which they had. Which is plaine by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Apoſtle; which is to convince them of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine groſſe ſinnes, as Rebellion, Vncleaneneſſe, Luſt. Now whereas they might have alledged, We are under greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges than they: he prevents them thus, Nay they had the ſame with you: The red ſea was their baptiſme, the like was the cloud which directed them; and their Manna and water out of the rocke was to them the ſame ſpirituall meate and drinke
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12335:20"/> which you have. If then they eſcaped not puniſhment of ſuch enormities, looke not you to eſcape. Many other Texts might be urged, all to evince this truth, that the old and new Sacraments, for ſubſtance and ſignification are one; even as their ſacrifices were one in ſubſtance and ſenſe, with Chriſt crucified. The Lord being very carefull that as his Church ſhould never lacke the beſt helpes to heaven: ſo they ſhould not have new and divers in ſubſtance, but the ſelfe ſame, that they might know the way to God and heaven was ſtill one and the ſame; and ſo goe on in their courſe comfortably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or ſtaggering. I conclude then that for ſubſtance there is one Chriſt, one faith, reconciliation, redemption, ſanctification and eternall life; the old and new Sacraments were one.</p>

And that both in their clearneſſe, number and efficacy. Touching the firſt, it will not bee darke to conceive, if wee conſider that a Sacrament is a relation to a covenant. If then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the old Church were darke, how much more the ſeale annexed? A ſeale (I grant) in her nature is a thing of great aſſurance and evidence: how be it, as we ſee in mens ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, the ſeale can be no more evident, than the covenant; if that be confuſed, partiall, and obſcure, the ſeale applyed to it, can but be darke. Now the covenant was darke, becauſe the foundation of it, which was and is Chriſt, was darke. They had heard and knew that God had made a covenant, both with mankinde in <hi>Adam,</hi> and more nearely with the Iewes in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sacraments in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obſcure.</note> and had annexed Circumciſion to it. They knew that this Covenant was twice or thrice renewed by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and after by the Prophets: but the ground of it in Chriſt the Meſſia being a twilight, a myſt unto them, the covenant needs muſt be ſo, and the ſeale ſutable. Alas, how few that heard of the covenant in the bleſſed Seede, could conceive it to bee a ſpirituall one, and not rather a carnall? How few knew what the perſon of the Meſſia ſhould be? How did they abhorre any thought of humility in him? As for his divinity and union, how could they dreame of it? much leſſe came they to ſee the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12335:20"/> atchieving of this redemption by his ſatisfaction, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and leaſt of all did they ſee eyther the myſtery of election in Chriſt, or the Fathers wrath pacified in the offer of grace, and the gift of faith to embrace it. But their eyes were held, that (except ſome few choice ones) they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw the ſcope of Sacrifices, Sacraments, or other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.<note place="margin">Luke 24, 16.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now if the foundation of the Covenant were hidded, how could the Covenant be cleare? If that were darke, how could their Sacraments be cleare? True it is, that as a in picture of a King rudely drawne in a ſhaddow, there is truly a King por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed: yet till his lineaments be fully expreſſed in colours, few can reach what it meanes. So heere, When a man is a farre off, we ſee him to be a man: but till he draw neare our view, we cannot ſee, ſalute and agnize him ſuch a one. So it is here. Ad hereto, that the law morrall (nor to ſpeake of the other) was (as it were) a veile to the eyes of the Iew,<note place="margin">The Law was as a veile of darkeneſſe.</note> that hee could not ſee what was within the veile; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2: <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.14.</note> For although the Lord gave it as an helpe for the preſent, fitteſt to curbe and bridle the rebellion of fierce ſpirits, and hard hearts, who were not yet fit to have any more ſpirituall things put upon them. Yet alas! The very interpoſition of it betweene them and Chriſt cauſed a woefull confuſion and darkeneſſe to come upon them. The law had in it enough to convince them of utter inability to performe it: but alas! which of them did ſo apprehend it, and not rather as a rule of ſuch obedience as they could performe themſelves? Now then what a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did this cauſe in them, in the true Coherence of Law and Chriſt? What a diſorder wrought it, and what a miſtake in their mindes, imagining that the Law was indeede this Covenant of life which they might obey, and ſo doing they ſhould fare well? Alas, what a poore preparative was this to Chriſt? How did it overthrow the Covenant of grace in him? without which the Covenant of workes or obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Hence then the Sacraments of the Goſpel become cleare, evident and manifeſt; not that thoſe other adde not an aſſurance to the Covenant, but becauſe (they ſerving to no other end but to ratifie the Covenant) cannot ſeale any further than accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the extent of the Covenant.</p>

                     <p>Touching the ſecond, the number.<note place="margin">The ſecond, Number. In old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament more Reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> The old Church and we differ in that alſo, yet here I muſt put a caveat. All the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and other writers agree that the old Church had more Sacraments than the new hath. But how? Surely the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (for being) were no more than ours, than two I meane; but they had more Elements of reſemblance then we. And that in two reſpects. Firſt, there was a multitude of ſignes wherewith the old Church was clogged and burdened (to keepe them the better within the bounds of true worſhip,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> from Idolls and wil-worſhip) which yet were ſo farre from helping, that they by account rather hindred the Sacrament. For indeed all the ceremonies, the ſacrifices, the Altar of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, the law of the firſt borne, and almoſt what not, did more or leſſe concerne and typify Chriſt as well as the Sacraments, although they were a little more reall, eſpecially circumciſion which was imprinted on their fleſh: yet I ſay (as one hath well expreſſed in the whole frame of ceremonies) all did relate in one reſpect or other, more or leſſe to Chriſt. How then could it be avoyded, but ſuch a multitude of ſemblances muſt detract from the peculiarity of Sacraments, which the Lord autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized with farre more ſignification and efficacy than the reſt? The number therefore of ſhaddowes hindred the people from diſcerning Sacraments in their diſtinct and ſpeciall uſe, from other inferior ones. But ſecondly and ſpecially, even the ſame Sacraments for realneſſe, yet held not countenance and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but admitted (according to ſucceſſion of time) divers elements. Which argued their impotency and changeableneſſe. Thus Circumciſion admitted two other compeers, <hi>viz.</hi> The paſſage of the red ſea, and the cloud over the Tabernacle in their travell, raining and wetting their bodies.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> The paſſeover admitted two other, <hi>viz.</hi> Manna, and the water of the Rocke, which was (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) the ſame ſpirituall drinke and food that wee have in our Supper. So then wee muſt not thinke
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12335:22"/> they had more Sacraments for ſence, kind and ſignification: but more Elements reiterated, and added (paſſage wiſe) tranſeunt ones added to the ſtanding, which (in the abſence of the others, intermitted in the Wilderneſſe) might ſtand them in ſteed. Now marke, the fewer, more ſtanding and leſſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacraments are, the ſtronger they be, and contrariwiſe the weaker. We know if Phiſitians diſtruſt their receits, they preſcribe the more: if builders diſlike the ſlightneſſe of their Timber, they put the more peeces into the building. So heere.</p>

Which want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I doe not aſcribe to the defect of true relation or union Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall; or as if I denied their Sacraments to be ſpirituall: for whatſoever ſacrament is not Chriſts and hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt annexed to it, is but a counterfeit. Circumciſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Chriſt Sacramentall, and ſo was the paſſeover. But the one ſort was onely a ſeale of a thing to come in time, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> other of the Goſpel ſeales of the ſame thing, come and already having performed whatſoever was promiſed. Now as a thing enjoyed excells a thing hoped for (ſay never ſo ſure) ſo the ſeale of the latter exceedes the former in all the efficacy of it, perſwaſion, peace joy, contentment to the ſoule. Abſence breeds ſuſpence, preſence expells it and repreſents certainty, and ſatisfaction to the receiver. So then this I ſay, ordinarily the Iew could not, (except in ſome eſpeciall caſes &amp; perſons) enjoy ſuch a meaſure of ſealing power from their Sacraments as we doe or may, they received not ſuch certainty of perſwaſion of their reconciliation &amp; being in Covenant as we, nor found ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fruit as we may. Becauſe the ſealing power of the Spirit and of faith, was but weake. As the King is, ſo his kingdome muſt be: if he obſcure and unknowne, his authoritie is weake. So heere in the old Teſtament. Chriſt himſelfe was an obſcure King, and Prieſt, and Prophet, in his Church: his Kingdome therefore and authority was according. But now, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is as the King, and ſtandeth in power, peace, and joy of the holy Ghoſt: and therefore needes muſt both the Word and Sacraments be ſo, by which, as by Channels they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veied. And yet doubtleſſe, God left them not deſtitute of ſuch fruite as that age was capable of: they were commanded to rejoyce in their feares and affections of gladneſſe and joy they had, and ſo ſpirituall as their carnall and ſenſuall ſpirits were fit to receive: the Lord ſupplying that want of ſpirituall cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which now is offred, by ſome ſenſible and outward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and expreſſions; ſo farre as the generals of a bleſſed ſeede to come and happineſſe by him were apprehended. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct kinde whereof perhaps wee can not ſo well diſtinguiſh.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12335:23"/> But to be ſure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> God finiſhed their dayes without the promiſe ſeene and fulfilled, that they without us ſhould not be perfect. I may ad one thing more out of <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. compared; That the weakeneſſe of diſpenſation and (as I may call it) barrenneſſe<note place="margin">Barrenneſſe.</note> of power in the miniſtry of the Word among the Iewes; made the Sacraments alſo as barren in their grace and ſealing power.

The Goſpel hath more fulneſſe of ſeede, and begets more unto God, than the Law could doe: and therefore Baptiſme is a farre fuller Sacrament to confirme the ſoule in her new birth than the other was. So for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Goſpel exceeds (by many degrees) the miniſtery of the Law in Point of her building up and nouriſhing the ſoule in the grace of the new birth: the Goſpel hath filled the breſts of the Church with farre more milke, and ſtored her with farre more proviſion than the old Teſtament could doe: For thereby the Spirit is powred our upon all fleſh.<note place="margin">Ioel 2.28. Eſa. 44, 3.</note> Looke what difference there was betweene them and us, for the fulneſſe of bodily food, that (in a ſort) may bee ſaid for ſpirituall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. How many Creatures for kind, or for Circumſtance (as in caſe of blood, or ſtrangled) might not they touth, the Hog, the Conie, the Hare, and many other both beaſt and foule, tame and wilde; which to us are cleane and ſanctified? How much more doth the Lord afford us fuller feede of the Sacrament of the Supper than their paſſeover? Even as a feaſt exceeds an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?

                        <note place="margin">The new more effectuall.</note>Now for us, our Sacraments are farre more effectual. The very change of the old into new argued the excellenter efficacy of them. As the traine of a Prince perſonally riding in progreſſe is richer than an Herald or Harbinger. The Sabbath (wee know) was changed at the reſurrection, to honour it: So the Sacraments at his annointing to his office, and at his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to magnifie them. How ſhould they ſo doe, if their Trayne were not greater? I meane if the ſpirit of Chriſt and his ſealing, perſwading, ſetling, comforting, pacifying,

Alſo, except that bleſſed traine of his Graces more glorious and plentifull, as humility, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſſe, patience, hope, love, zeale; ability to walke with God more cloſely, to diſcharge our callings more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to ſuffer more willingly, to live by faith more ſetledly, and the like gifts of Chriſt Sacramentall, attended them? Hence is that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo common, Our Sacraments (ſaith he) are in efficacie greater than theirs, in profite more gainefull, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance more eaſie, and in number fewer. Beſide ours, in their underſtanding are moſt ſublime, in obſervation moſt pure, and in ſignification moſt excellent. They lived in the Porch of Sacraments, we in the Parlour. Let us take heede, leaſt, as they in their age, when no Nation under heaven en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed any Sacraments, ſave themſelves; were ſo puffed up by their priviledge, that they diſdained all as Dogges in reſpect of themſelves, cleaving onely to the barke of theſe Ordinances, without any ſeeking after the Spirit and power of them: and ſo opened a way to Gods wrath, to bring into their ſteed the Gentiles, who alwayes thirſted after them: ſo let us feare leaſt wee ſtand ſo much upon our dignitie above theirs, that in the meane time there ſhall be found even among us, baptized ones, and communicants far more blinde, prophane, careleſſe, than the Iewe was; yea and ſome of us who goe for better, be found as formall, barren, as far from the Covenant, as eſtranged from forgiveneſſe, and as deſtitute of the life and ſealing power of Baptiſme and the Supper, as they of their Circumciſion and Paſſeover. If it be ſo, our dignitie ſhall ſo lift us up to heaven, that it ſhall throw us downe to hell; and I will not only ſay, the Lord will not be pleaſed with us, as with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 5.</note> but as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.3.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2.3.</note> by how much more powerfull grace is put into his Sacraments, and by how much more eminent waies and ordinances hee hath honoured us: by ſo much the more ſhall our condemnation for our unbeleeefe be more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than theirs, who had ſo dimme a Covenant, and ſo weake Seales in compariſon of us. Rather let us labour to enjoy the priviledge of our priviledge above them, in carrying about us that evidence of faith, and that peace of conſcience, and that joy of ſoule, which our Sacraments
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12335:24"/> ſeale up to us; that wee may be as much better than they, as our Sacraments excell theirs in efficacy: and then that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt within us, as well as that without us, ſhall be a kingdome not of words onely and ſignes, but of power alſo.

They are both ancient, (and within three yeares one as ancient as the other:) they are both alike publique, as being equall legacies of the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant: they have both one founder (although the one by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Commiſſion, as Baptiſme by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary calling, the other immediatly by Chriſt himſelfe:) they both agree in the Name, Neceſſity of a Sacrament.

                     <p>But in a word, that I would ſay of their mutuall agreement<note place="margin">Their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> is this; Firſt, they both agree in the offer and repreſentation of whole Chriſt joyntly and undividedly to the ſoule.

A ſpeciall point to be noted for the better underſtanding of the act of faith in applying Imputation and Sanctification both at
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12335:24"/> once to the ſoule, (of which point I treat elſewhere.)

                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Sealing Chriſt.</note> in reſpect of their ſealing up of all Chriſt to the ſoule, (of which in the next Chapter,) for, except both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in ſealing, neither of both do ſeale him: True it is, that ſome further thing is offered to the ſoule in the Supper than was in Baptiſme, but yet becauſe ſtill one Chriſt is offered in both, therefore encreaſe of grace cannot be ſealed up where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting and begetting hath not beene already conferred by ſpirituall Baptiſme. Neither without other give whole Chriſt (if both may be enjoyed) although each give him wholy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is inſeparable from himſelfe: the whole ſoule is in each member which is in the whole body; yet if we divide the toe from the foot, there will be no ſoule in the toe. Take Baptiſme from the Supper, and the Supper can bee no ſealing Supper: for how ſhall life be encreaſed in a thing which never had true life begotten in it? I conclude then, The Sacraments of the Goſpell although they are two, yet do not cut Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts (as the Child which <hi>Salomon</hi> bid to be divided in two parts) but ſtill offer one Chriſt to be communicated. Both thoſe harlots could not have one and the ſame child: but all Chriſts members have that one Child, Ieſus Sacramentall; although for ſeverall ends (as by and by ſhall appeare) one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to create him, the other to enlarge him: yet both agree in exhibiting one Ieſus. Of the uſe anon.</p>
                     <p>Now laſtly, touching their diſagreement,<note place="margin">Their diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, in five things.</note> as it ſtandes in many leſſer thing, ſo in the particular ends eſpecially; for the former, they are theſe five, 1. Order,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Order</hi> 1.</note> 2. Frequency, 3. Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, 4, Elements, 5. Subject. For the firſt. The order of them, is, that baptiſme goes before, and the Supper fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, even as being goes before proſpering. Yet I deny not but thouſands have beleeved ere baptiſed; but now I ſpeake of the order of the ſeales, not otherwiſe. Which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12335:25"/> the folly of ſuch as would deferre baptiſme to the laſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of their life, out of an errour, both that it conferd grace by a vertue inherent, and that it pardoned ſins onely paſt. By which folly ſome bereft themſelves of Baptiſme finally, by ſudden death. Secondly, in frequency.<note place="margin">Secondly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</note> Baptiſme it but once to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, the Supper often. We are but once borne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rebaptizing of Anabaptiſts is a curſed profanation: not onely in reſpect of their condemning Infants baptiſme in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but of repeating baptiſme adminiſtred, although by or in a falſe hereticall Church: for even ſuch baptiſme muſt not be doubled; if the myſtery of the Trinity &amp; the Doctrine of Chriſt be maintained in any generality, although with much corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The like I may ſay of thoſe that denyed to reſtore them that were once lapſed, upon pretence that then they muſt bee rebaptized; and alſo them that preſumed to rebaptiſe ſuch as they received againe into the Church, after their repentance of ſome notorious hereſie, or odious practiſe which they had fallen into or committed. Noe, we abhorre ſuch ſcurfe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming one Baptiſme, and that one, once to bee given to the Church for true ſealing up the ingrafting of the ſoule into Chriſt when it ſhall beleeve the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in opportunitie or ſeaſon.<note place="margin">Thirdly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Which I ſpeake not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively but upon ſuppoſition of the Churches wiſedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in determining the ſeaſon of the Supper to be in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leaving the ſeaſon of Baptiſme indefinite as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. And that, becauſe the one being adminiſtred to growne ones, requires fit and due ſeaſon to quicken them up, which in the other is not requiſite. But for all this, I doe affirme no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to be in this ſeaſon of the Supper, ſeeing its in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches power to alter the morning to the afternoone; and if we ſhould ſo receive, I dare not impeach it, ſo it be done without confuſion. The fourth is the Elements,<note place="margin">Fourthly the Elements.</note> the one having Water, the other Bread and Wine; both ſerving pertinently to the uſes they were made for, and neither having in them any fitneſſe to reſemble each others uſe; water being no more fit to nouriſh, than bread to waſh, but each ſuiting properly to his end. The laſt is the Subject;<note place="margin">Fiftly the ſubject.</note> the one the Infant, the other the growne, and ſuch as are of diſcretion. Which I ſpeake not as if the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12335:25"/> Church may Baptiſe none but Infants: for as it doth baptize them as lawfully, in the faith of the Parents, and in hope of their owne (when they come to underſtand the Covenant) as it offers the Supper to actuall beleevers; ſo yet if any ſuch be brought into the Church as never was baptized, being (as falles out) of twelve, twentie, thirtie yeeres: the Church is bound upon the due examination of ſuch, and confeſſion of his faith, to baptize him as well as an Infant. But for the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to admit children, (though under colour of ripe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace above others) its not a fit thing, in reſpect of ſcandall and opening a way to the profanation of Sacraments by others of like age: not to ſpeake of the raſhneſſe of it, in aſcribing that to raw youth, which requireth ſetling of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſoundnes of affection. But of all other differences,<note place="margin">Addition.</note> the particular ends are greateſt; in which the two Sacraments are irreconciliable. The one ſo ſerving for the Breed of a new Creature; the other for the Supper thereof,<note place="margin">See Chap. infra.</note> that neither can or ought to be applied to others end or uſe; as in their due place ſhall be ſpoken.</p>

                     <p>The latter is the ſimplicitie of materials in the Sacrament. A queſtion may be asked, why the Lord ſhould appoint ſo home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, triviall, and common Elements? As we ſee water in Baptſme is a common thing, bread and wine uſuall ordinary creatures, nothing in them ſtrange, farre off, precious or ſolemne to the ſence. Why rather choſe hee not to deſcribe the price of thoſe graces, offered in the Sacraments, by ſome rare and coſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? Anſwer. This indeede ſounds beſt to our ſuperſtitious and fantaſticall hearts: as to <hi>Naaman,</hi> when he heard of <hi>Iordans</hi> waters, by &amp; by,<note place="margin">2 King. 5, 11.</note> the better waters of <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharphar</hi> were preſented by carnall reaſon. But as God had another purpoſe to him in the healing of him by waters; he meant not to magnifie the one above the other, but rather to magnifie his power and grace above them both; ſo heere. More diſtinctly theſe two maine cauſes may be aſſigned for the meannes of the Elements. 1. The generalneſſe. 2. The ſafetie of them. For the firſt, water,<note place="margin">Firſt, For the generality.</note> bread and wine are Elements, generally to be come by and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with eaſe. Rare is that country that wants them; now it was meet that the moſt geneall materials be appointed for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, leaſt elſe the preciouſneſſe and difficulty of getting them, ſhould either hinder the uſe (at leaſt frequently:) for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny congregations are ſo brutiſh at this day, that they ſhun oft communions for the matter of charge) or elſe give occaſion to the curioſity of men to deviſe diverſities of ſupplies, and ſo to bring in a confuſion. But the Elements being ſo generall that ſcarce any country is to be found that wants them (and if ſome odde ones ſhould, yet the uſe of rootes (ſerving for their bread) is the more pardonable, this danger is prevented. The 2. and more chiefe is, prevention of carnall worſhip,<note place="margin">Secondly, ſafeneſſe.</note> that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may be preſerved more ſafe and entire from ſenſualitie and pompe. If the Lord had appointed a feaſt of pompe and ſtate, coſtly junkets, rich attires of Prieſts to uſher and ſerve in ſome rare coſtly cates, either naturall or artificiall, as at this day the Papiſts boaſt of their brave Sacraments, and rich
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12335:31"/> ſetting them forth with embroydered attires,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.3.</note> ſumptuous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopies, Pixes, Proceſſions, and Pageants; lo, all the glory of ſpirituall Sacraments would turne into outward pompe and oſtentation; as we ſee <hi>Ahaz</hi> more ſolicitous of the ſtate of his Altar which he offered upon,<note place="margin">2 King. 16, 10.</note> than the ſubſtance of worſhip and ſacrifice. No ſooner was poore <hi>Moſes</hi> gone out of ſight, but the Iſraelites muſt have a Calfe of gold to looke upon, to offer unto, to feaſt, and play and dance before it, this pleaſed their Idolatrous humor well. And even juſt ſo, it well pleaſeth the carnall humor of Papiſts to have ſuch places of worſhip ſo painted, &amp; embelliſhed, ſuch materials in this worſhip, as might amuze their fleſhly eyes and ſences, eate up their ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man, checke the life and ſavor of faith, and pleaſe a lazie and ſenſuall heart with ſhewes and ſhaddowes, that they may depart as wiſe as they came. Contrarily the Lord ſtrives to provoke us to ſerve him ſpiritually; and therfore ſetteth meane objects before our ſence, to the end we may know, that there is ſome further object there for us to looke at, than the bare Elements. That ſo, by how much this feaſt comes ſhort of mens banquets, by ſo much the more the heart might not reſt upon outward receiving, but ſeeke a ſupply of outward, by inward and ſpirituall dainties, not ſeene: and ſeeke the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. Even as a father ſeeing his child proud of fine clothes,<note place="margin">Col. 3, 2.</note> make him a ſute of ſackin or leather, to take downe over-great delight in himſelf; ſo heere, to crack the pride of carnality the Lord clothes his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments meanly; and ſo puls up the heart to himſelf.

Touching the firſt; The Lord in making a Sacrament, beholds the materiall Elements in their naturall aptitude and peculiar Symbolicalneſſe to expreſſe ſuch a thing. To open this, Conſider that things are ſaid to be apt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier to reſemble, either by a made aptneſſe, which is not in the thing it ſelfe, but put upon it accidentally: or elſe is apt by an agreeableneſſe in it ſelfe, ſo to doe. In Latine we would thus diſtinguiſh them,<note place="margin">Proprietie double. Firſt, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall.</note> [<hi>Apta facta,</hi> or, <hi>Apta nata:</hi>] of the firſt ſort are all ſuch things (whether Reall or Nominall, or Notionall,) as have their ſignification from an outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of them that impoſe this aptneſſe. As I know when I heare the name of London, Yorke, or Dover, what places are, and what are not ſignified and meant: Why? How comes my conceit to faſten upon ſuch a citie by the mention of ſuch a name? Surely from no naturall aptneſſe in the names to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one city rather than another; but by impoſition and conſent, or cuſtome, which is as good as a naturall aptneſſe to decipher ſuch a place: men will ſo call it, therefore it prevailes to be apt to it. Of this kinde are all watch-words, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.5.<note place="margin">Dan. 3, 5,</note> When the noiſe of all kind of Muſique ſounded, then was it thought a fit ſeaſon <hi>to fall downe and worſhip the Image.</hi> Why?

A ſecond therefore is naturall,<note place="margin">Secondly, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</note> when a thing hath pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar aptneſſe in it ſelfe to reſemble; although the things are of never ſo different kinde, yet in their kinde, they concurring in one third notion; looke what is in the one, doth, or may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to deſcribe the other, even of it ſelfe.

                        </gap>efreſhing of the heart. And this latter is the aptneſſe which our Saviour beholds Elements in: ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar aptneſſe as might alone carrie the minde of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that which is ſignified. And hence is that of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Except Sacramentall ſignes had a Symbolicalneſſe with the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12335:32"/> things they repreſent, they could be no Sacraments; meaning, they could not be ſo apt to reſemble. For howſoever the Lord might by his power have made any ſigne to become a Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and that becauſe hee ſo pleaſed; yet, ſeeing in this hee ſought not the declaring of what hee could doe, but of that which is beſt for the convincement of diſtruſt, and dulneſſe of our nature, he rather choſe ſuch Elements as might out of their owne congruity, reſemble things ſpirituall. Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation then requires a naturall aptneſſe to reſemble.</p>
                     <p>The latter and maine peece of Appropriation, is divine,<note place="margin">Secondly, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Elements by divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Proofe of it.</note> and peculiar application, not onely in generall to ſerve for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe, but in ſpeciall to note out, typifie, and deſcribe to the ſoule the Lord Ieſus Sacramentall, for breeding and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſoule in grace. Now this is a further thing than the former; determining the propertie of the creature and the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof to reſemble, unto this ſpeciall reſembling of Chriſt Crucified in his waſhing qualitie, and his nouriſhing propertie. Although there were never ſuch aptneſſe in a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to doe thus in it ſelfe, yet it hath nothing to doe to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with a Sacrament, except the Lord doe ſpecially appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it to ſerve for ſuch a purpoſe; and then it begins to have in it a Sacramentall proportion, and power to raiſe the ſoule from earth to heaven, whereas elſe it ſelfe being earthly, it were more likely to naile downe the heart to it ſelfe and to earthly thoughts and affections; But ſo potent is the worke of the Ordainer, who hath put this peculiar property into it, that although it be but a creature, yet it carries the ſoule from earth to heaven, in a moſt familiar manner. And marke, how this ſtands in the power of the Word. Wee know that the common bleſſing of the creature to feede and cheriſh the body, comes from the Word: <hi>Man not living by bread, but by the Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.</hi> How much more then muſt the vertue of the Ordinance come from God to make this carnall nouriſhing creature, to be a ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher? Hence it is that <hi>Austin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Accedat verbum, &amp;c.</hi> Let the Word come to the Element, and there is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Yet, wee muſt know the former makes way to this; the aptneſſe and ſpeciall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſignes to this uſe, helpes much the minde to conceive: but this is the more immediate object of faith to faſten upon Chriſt, that the Sacraments are no longer the bread of the Lord, but bread the Lord, wine the Lord, and water the Lord. And this Sacramentall union is an act of Gods ordeining Spirit and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12335:34"/> Authority, by vertue whereof the Lord Ieſus, in all his merits and efficacy is not onely reſembled and preſented by apt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the minde, but really made one with the Elements, that by them and with them he might be carried into the ſoule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably for aſſurance of union and Communion with God. Hence it is that the Scripture ſpeakes in ſuch a phraſe, This is my body, This is my blood of the New Teſtament:<note place="margin">Luk. 22, 19. 1 Cor. 5, 7.

Man and Wife are one fleſh, no more two but one: how? by vertue of divine inſtitution: this union is reall and true, yet not meerely Phyſicall and naturall oneneſſe, but in the kind of it, a matrimoniall union.

                        <note place="margin">All vnions ſerve to make God and the ſoule one.</note>This point will the better appeare, if we goe a little further, and ſhew that even the greateſt and deepeſt unions that are, ſerve to make way for the union and communion of the ſoule with her firſt originall, hereafter in glory, and here in grace. The very perſonal union of the Trinity, how ſhould it be better conceived than by the myſtery of redemption? wherein God could not poſſibly have ſatisfied God, nor man bee brought and united to God, except there had beene a perſonall union, that is, a ſamenes of deity in the differing of perſons. The like is true in the union of Chriſts Godhead with the nature and fleſh of man: why was it, but to ſerve Gods holy purpoſe to reconcile and unite fleſh to God by the perſon of <hi>Emanuel?</hi> So alſo, that ſpirituall union of the whole body and ſoule of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever with Chriſt, why is it, but to prepare it for eternall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him? The union (or communion rather) of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt into one body and being, to what ſerves it but that the whole Church may be one with Chriſt and her head, that by him ſhee might be one with God himſelfe, who ſhall be all in all in glory, wholly poſſeſſing and poſſeſſed? So alſo wonder not if this inferior union of Sacraments, be ſo reall and cloſe: ſeeing its cleare, the Lord in this, condeſcending ſo low to the Capacity of man, unites himſelfe no otherwiſe to the Elements, than that in and by them as channels of conveyance, he might (when and where he ſees it good to uſe them) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive himſelfe into the poore beleeving ſoule in a fuller aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Communion with her? So that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mervaile not that I ſaid unto you, he that eates and drinkes my fleſh and blood,</hi>

                        </gap>ſiſts the Nature of the things united and preſent. Secondly, neither will their nature admit a phyſicall Preſence or union; that is, ſuch an union as by which the proper formes and beings of the things united are loſt, and become under a new forme of mixture or compoſition. For the Natures of Chriſt and the Bread are incompatible in point of mixture or compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becauſe the one is a ſpirituall, the other a corporall thing, which admit no ſuch mixture as corporall things of like nature doe, as wine and water. So then if this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee not mixt, it is much leſſe Tranſubſtantiate: for in that, the one doth not mixe with, but evacuate and diſanull the other, leaving nothing of ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>

And againe, nothing hinders why two things phyſically diſjoyned, may not yet ſpiritually be one, and joyned together, by vertue of the power of the ordainer. In a word, the Nature of the things united will admit a reall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12335:36"/> union, although no corporall unnion, eyther locall or mixt, and much leſſe tranſubſtantiall: therefore the things united in the Sacraments are onely ſpiritually and really united.</p>

Touching the firſt, the ſoule, the ſpirit, the faith of the receiver looke at the ſpirit of the Sacrament, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus crucified: The hand, the eye, the mouth of the receiver, looke at the Elements onely: Doe not thinke then that the carnall part can meddle with the ſpirituall, nor the ſpirituall with the carnal (as it is ſo,) but the outward man, ſees, touches, taſts and digeſts the outward: the ſpirituall beholds, taſtes and enjoyes the ſpirituall, each muſt keepe his owne bounds. If I would diſcerne an outward thing in the Sacrament, I muſt uſe my ſence, my touch, my taſt: and if theſe convince it to bee carnall, ſo it is: Againe, if I would diſcerne a ſpirituall thing there, I muſt conſult with my inward man and the inner ſence of faith, and thereby I muſt pronounce an inner thing to be preſent: If I want eyes and ſence, I can perceive no outward thing.

                     <p>To the end I may perceive there bee true Materialls in the Sacrament, and not onely bare accidents without a ſubſtance,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12335:37"/> the outward ſenſe is triall ſufficient: ſight, touch, and taſte, will not eaſily erre about their owne objects, as our Saviour tells his Diſciples, Looke upon and handle me, for a ſpirit hath no object of Touch,<note place="margin">Luke 24, 39.</note> fleſh, blood, and bones, as ye ſee me have. Againe, if the queſtion be of a ſpirituall being or body, and blood of Chriſt: let ſenſe and teeth goe, there faith and the Spirit of Chriſt muſt convince it, if that feele the beames, warmth, and ſee the light and taſt the influence iſſuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: then certainly they are there, for the Spirit cannot bee deceived about her owne object. Onely this I adde. Neither of theſe can be ſevered from other: for by the externall, the Lord hath appointed to convey the ſpirituall, and not without them; and in that relation of each to other, even the meaneſt ought to be honoured; and the outward ſenſe ought to bee ſo buſied about the objects of ſence, as thereby to helpe, ſuccour, and ſtrengthen the weakeneſſe of faith in the object, that is, ſpirituall.

As then its a truth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Elements and the Lord Ieſus were one, no bad recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be guilty of eating his owne condemnation: ſo yet, if this vnion be conceived as tranſubſtantiall, it is impoſſible it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12335:37"/> ſhould be Sacramentall. For Sacramentall union ſtill is ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, which its impoſſible to conceive in things changed into a naturall ſameneſſe and ſubſtance. As wee know, in common ſpeech we ſay, No like thing is the ſame, becauſe a like thing is like to another.

                     <p>This error of theirs as it came from the forge of carnall reaſon firſt, and the ſavor of the kitchin,<note place="margin">How popiſh errour grew.</note> ſo it received varniſh from the erronious conceiving of Scriptures and Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Sacramentall union.

                     <p>I proceede to the laſt generall in the definition, which is the end of a Sacrament. And that is double, eyther concerning us from God, or God from us. Both (as I noted) are the ſcope of a Sacrament. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe the Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends full as much, and neither more not leſſe, than the covenant doth: (I meane the covenant of grace.) But the covenant of grace is reciprocall: That God be our God,<note place="margin">Both eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall: Gen. 17.1.</note> and wee be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that God be our God al-ſufficient and we walke uprightly before him. I doe not meane by reciprocalneſſe, any equality in working: as if our obeying, or uprightneſſe could worke God to be ours, as his being ours, workes us to be upright: But that indifferently the one as well as the other part and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is interchangably requiſite on our parts, as well as the Lords. As then the ſeale of the covenant aſſures the one, ſo muſt it the other; it muſt ſecure the Lord of our upright walking, as well as us, of his beeing our God: both muſt needs goe together. Yet I meane not that the Sacraments doe equally ſeale up both: for Gods ſealing grace to us is ſtrong, our ſealing backe to him of duty, is weake: the Sacrament is the Lords, and therefore principally aymes at our good: yet I ſay God lookes for it that the ſame meſſenger of his unchangable love to us revived at the Sacrament, ſhould carry backe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12335:40"/> to him our revived covenant of upright walking. The Lord ſo comes to his oath and ſeale for our ſecurity, that hee lookes we alſo come to the oath of Covenant with him: hee will not be tyed, and wee be looſe. Firſt then of the former of theſe two ends, Gods end concerning us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">What God covenanteth.</note>Touching which, let us conceive what God covenanteth, and ſo we ſhall ſee what the Sacraments doe aſſure. Touching this point, of the offer and Covenant of God, I having elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where largely ſpoken,<note place="margin">Practic. Catech. Part <hi>2.</hi> Artic. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> therefore I doe here referre my reader to that diſcourſe, to ſpare a labour. Onely thus much in a word; when <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt his integrity by diſanulling the covenant of creation; the Lord had it in his boſome, what he would doe with all his poſterity: if hee had quite deſtroyed them all, it had beene but juſt: In this demurre, grace caſt the skole, and brought him (out of his meere good pleaſure) to purpoſe to recover a Remnant out of their ruine. And as hee meant this within himſelfe, ſo he thought it meete, to expreſſe ſo much to us, not by including ſome and excluding others, but by a free unconditionall offer of grace (in reſpect of any thing in man) to covenant with him to be his God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come propitious and favorable againe unto him, as if hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had beene offended. This covenant he eſtabliſhes with us in the Blood of his Sonnes ſatisfaction: requiring of us, to beleeve that thereby his Majeſty is reconciled with us, and that therefore we be reconciled to him: This he urges us to beleeve nakedly, upon his bare word and covenant, and that we ſeeke no ſtarting holes; but ſet too our ſeale, that he meanes no leſſe than his words import, for his Sonnes ſake, that he will be our God and forgive us. Now there is weight in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe alone, ſufficient to overpeize our infidelity: But ſuch is the baſeneſſe of ſpirit in us, being diſabled by our fall, that neither can our feebleneſſe reach it, or remember and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to us in due ſort: and much leſſe our guilty, ſlaviſh and treacherous hearts (which muſe as they uſe, and thinke God like themſelves, to hate them whom they have hurt) can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it.</p>
                     <p>Heere the Lord not content with the bare offer and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace in Chriſt: rather than he would leave any (who
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12335:40"/> is not wilfully an enemy and hating reconciliation) unconvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his unfeignedneſſe of meaning to doe as he ſpeakes,<note place="margin">What the Sacraments doe aſſure.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends ſo low, as to ſtoope to our weake, forgetfull and baſe hearts: and therefore comes (as the author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>cap.</hi> 6, 17.18.<note place="margin">Heb. 6, 17, 18f</note>) to joyne an oath to his Covenant; That by two things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye: we might have ſtrong conſolation in our taking refuge, upon purſuit of our conſcience, Satan, or any enemies. Now what is the oath of God in the Ghoſpell? Surely no other ſave his ſeales, that is, his Sacraments (which I take to bee no ſmall cauſe why the Fathers deviſed the Name of a Sacrament, that is, an oath.) This oath or ſeale (call it as you will) muſt be that uttermoſt ſecurity which the Lord can or will reach us forth in his Goſpell, to take away our diſtruſt and ſlavery; That as among men in the greateſt Controverſies, an oath is beyond all expectation able to decide the doubt: ſo in this matter of Gods open and hearty meaning in his covenant, if the ſoule queſtion it, he deſires that his oath might put an end to our unbeleefe. The Lord (to ſpeake with reverence) taking a kinde of corporall oath in the Sacrament: I take theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Elements united to the Crucified fleſh of my Sonne to witneſſe: that as ſurely as nothing can ſever from the one, a cleanſing, feeding, cheriſhing quality to the bodyes of the creatures to whom my word hath ſo appointed them; ſo, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ſeparate the quickning, comforting, and refreſhing quality of my Sonnes ſatisfaction, (that is, my love and grace) from the ſoules of them, whom I have ordained it unto; I ſwere and vow, my Sonne is theirs, as truely as the bread they eate, and the wine they drinke.</p>
                     <p>Let us then collect out of this that hath beene ſayd, a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold end of Sacraments; 1. To be Glaſſes. 2. Memorialls, 3. Pledges and that of beſt aſſurance (if oath &amp; ſeale be ſufficient) of the true meaning of God to the Soule in bidding it be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>

Nay, to ſpeak more fully, the Lord in the aſſuring of the bargain of his grace, doth much like to an honeſt man willing to ſell his inheritance.

Now ſeeing the Sacraments containe, partly things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, partly carnall: the former whereof are to be carried and conveyed by the mediation of the latter: it followeth that the externall Elements muſt be conveyed, by externall and ſenſible agents, to ſenſible objects, by ſenſible Rites and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Conceive then, the Lord Ieſus being wholly given of God in each Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though for divers ends) this former Sacrament offers him wholly, in point of our new birth, or the new creature; Chriſt in all his breadth, height, depth and length; Chriſt for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and regeneration.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12335:55"/> for our calling, or for our imputation, or for our ſanctification. Howbeit, for my owne exerciſe in part, and for the clearer view of Chriſt ſacramentall in the water: I would adde a little more, deſiring the weake reader to pardon my diſtinctions, as more meete for ſuch as better conceive (or would at leaſt) the gift of Chriſt in his extent and fulneſſe.<note place="margin">Diſtinction of it to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> The grace then of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in baptiſme, is either firſt grace, or conſequent upon it. The firſt grace I call, either that which maketh us accepted, or that which is freely given to in here and abide in us. Concerning the former kind: Grace accepting is eyther grace of meanes ſerving to atteine acceptance, or the grace it ſelfe atteined. The former, of meanes, in one word is the grace of vocation in al the paſſages thereof, preventing, aſſiſting, and perfitting this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the ſoule. The grace it ſelfe of acceptance attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may be diſtinguiſht into grace eyther of maine eſſence, or of priviledge. Grace of maine eſſence is double, eyther juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our perſons from ſinne of guilt and blemiſh; or of curſe (wherein Gods acquitting us in judgement by remiſſion and pardon, properly conſiſts:) or reconciliation, by which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardoned we returne to grace and favour againe as before, our blood being reſtored, and we beloved. Then ſecondly, grace of priviledge is double: poſitive or privative. Poſitive priviledg in a word is our adoption: which (beſides favor) reſtores us to the former conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (yet much bettered) of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſons, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, heires: and ſo to the priviledges of a beleever according to the ſeverall occaſions of his life &amp; courſe. Privative in a word, ſtands in rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption: that is freedome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the evills, dangers, enemies, croſſes, within without, bodily, ghoſtly, which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten annoyance to our happy eſtate in Chriſt. Thus for the 1. ſort.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond are graces inherent in us; in a word, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man, body, ſoule, and ſpirit, ſtanding both in Conſcience and converſation. And this is double, eyther morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and conſumption of the old man,<note place="margin">Gal, 5, 24.</note> renouncing him with his affection: and luſts, &amp; crucifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all with Chriſts or elſe quickning up of the ſoule in the bent, frame, intent and ſtreame of it, to the life of God and grace. Thus of the firſt grace. The conſequent upon this is, the proper iſſue &amp; fruit of each of theſe firſt graces which they leave behind them in the ſoule: The
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12335:55"/> proper iſſue of vocation, is union and bringing to God by the inſtrument of faith. The proper iſſue of juſtification is peace and quiet of conſcience.

For if we have beene planted together with him into the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall alſo be to the likeneſſe of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> And note this further, that as the holy Ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the meriting cauſes diverſly, now by one, then by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his mediation: ſo ſometime he applyes that his merit to one fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Marke, the reſurrection of Chriſt, being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe of his ſatisfaction, and the declaring of it, is made here the meriting cauſe of the grace of Baptiſme: But by it, all the ſatisfaction is meant: And the effect of this Baptiſme is called, The anſwer of a good conſcience, which is the peace
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12335:56"/> and ſecurity of it, properly iſſuing from pardon of ſinne and guilt: yet in and by this, all are meant, both juſtification and ſanctification. The ſelfe ſame phraſe is uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.<note place="margin">Heb. 10, 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and your bodyes waſhed with pure water,</hi> that is, with peace. For this blood, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 12. cryeth <hi>better things than that of Abel.</hi> The phraſe of ſprinkling compares Baptiſme to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> ſprinkling their doore poſts with the blood of the Lambe. If they had not done it,<note place="margin">Exod. 12, 22.</note> they had beene in danger of ſlaying by the Angel.

So baptiſme is a better ſprinkling of a better blood, upon a better object, to a farre better peace, even peace of conſcience, as being paſſed from death to life. By all theſe places not unmeet to be conferred together, we ſee, that whole Chriſt crucified, Chriſt in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Chriſt in our Regeneration, Chriſt in our union, and by it all his benefits are the extent of the grace of baptiſme. And that the Miniſter ſtanding in Gods ſtead, applying water to the Baptiſed, doth by it apply the power of the Lord Ieſus by the Spirit accompanying the ſame, to create a new birth of Grace and life in the ſoule. The which worke of the Spirit I ſhall more revive in the firſt uſe of this point.</p>

This word will give a bottome to thy feete to ſtand upon, while thou reacheſt out with thine hand to take Chriſt; ſo that thou ſhalt not ſtagger.

                        <note place="margin">It goes with the Spirit.</note>Further, bee aſſured this word of Chriſt in his promiſe of the Sacrament never goes alone: The truth of it alway is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Spirit of Chriſt in the water.

And looke what I ſayd before about the choyce of Elements, and ſuch like things: the ſame I ſay of the adminiſtration of that Sacrament, that all muſt fetch their warrant from hence. I doe not meane that each circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of action, which our Saviour or the Diſciples perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; is neceſſarily included in the Inſtitution: No, there may be ſundry perſonall acts done in this or any other ſervice of God, which when they are done, become worſhip, and yet are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary to doe or not, as the perſons are diſpoſed; onely plaine and unavoydable reſpects of defilements, and true ſcandall, are to be avoyded: But by [Inſtitution] I meane thoſe eſſentialls of matter and perpetuall rites about it, which our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his Diſciples performed. Theſe I affirme are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable, both one and other: It being as ſinfull to offend in the due forme of Baptizing, as in changing the Element: and ſo, as unlawfull to alter the words of Inſtitution in giving the Supper, as in changing the Elements, or in taking away their number. And hence it is that <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 20.</note> being to correct the foule abuſe crept into their Supper, by Love feaſts, calls them to the Inſtitution, wherein ſeeing no ſuch thing could be ſeene, therefore he pares it off as ſuperfluous. In like ſort the Church of Chriſt hath abhorred all ſuch additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of traſh and humane invention, as crept in, in their ages: as Creame, Salt, Oyle added to water; detraction of the Cup in the Supper, diſanulling of the union, and turning the materiall of a Sacrament into the forme, ſo that there ſhould not bee a difference in the thing ſignifying and ſignified: and ſo at this day we renounce the errors of the Greeke Church, mixing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with wine, and their old abuſe of fire in Baptiſme to marke the face of the infant: and infinite others of the like ſort: ſome of which defile, others diſanull the Inſtitution, both infringe it.

Still I muſt put in this, that the Miniſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe can doe nothing: (oftentimes he is farre from being bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe) but the obedience to the inſtitution doth it. Now by bleſſing is meant ſanctifying:<note place="margin">What it is? Sanctifying.</note> the word being taken from the ordinary manner of the Iewes in their feaſts and meales, whoſe graces were called bleſſings, becauſe the firſt word of them was,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 10.</note> Bleſſed be God who cauſeth bread to grow out of the earth, and who giveth wine out of the grape, &amp;c. From hence our Saviour is ſaid to bleſſe bread and wine (though in another forme, and to an higher end, yet in generall) as in the uſe of the creatures. And the truth is, whoſoever they be that dare come neare the Table of the Lord, and the bleſſing of the Miniſter, being privy of ordinary uſing the creatures without bleſſing, are fit to bee quite excluded from this Sacrament. Remember the phraſe of this bleſſing iſſued from that.</p>
                     <p>Now beſides this bleſſing, although it properly denote Thankes, yet it includes prayer alſo:<note place="margin">Firſt by Prayer.</note> Both make up the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sacrament. Our manner at this day is to ſay, Wee give thankes: not as if we did nothing elſe, or as if prayer were inferior to it; but ſo the uſe of ſpeech hath prevailed. Firſt then our Saviour prayed, and ſecondly prayſed and gave thankes to his Father, and in both ſtood this ſecond act of bleſſing. He was in this his act ſubject (as mediator) to his Father, and ſo acknowledged no leſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That looke what hee did, hee did deputedly from him as the cheefe Agent in the ſanctifying of the Sacrament. And even ſo is the Miniſter much more to doe in his ſtead: not to arrogate to himſelfe Popiſhly this power, but to abaſe himſelfe to the loweſt earth, as a worme creeping out of her hole, when he lifts up his heart in this kind to the Lord, in the behalfe of the Church, for a bleſſing upon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12335:73"/> the Sacrament. Its farre from him or his intention, to make or not to make the Sacrament, it depends upon an higher power. For in this caſe without queſtion, the greater is bleſſed of the leſſer, to wit, inſtrumentally.</p>
                     <p>For the former of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> our Saviours prayer: its not to be wondred at, that its a part of this bleſſing. For why?<note place="margin">Why?</note> It was put up to his Father, to the end that he would give his ſolemne conſent to it, and by his word eſtabliſh it to bee a Sacrament. Even our bleſſing the creatures is by applying the ſtrength of the Word;<note place="margin">Matth. 4.4.</note> for man lives not by bread, but by each word of God. So that our Saviour here craveth a word from his Father,<note place="margin">1 King. 8.22.</note> for the bleſſing of this Ordinance. <hi>Salomon</hi> when he conſecrated the Temple: what did hee?

Touching the firſt, wee ſee no warrant for the Maſſe Prieſts inchanting the Elements by his whiſpering the five words over them: for lo, the Conſecration was ended, ere any of thoſe five words were pronounced: and therefore, not thoſe words, but Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Prayer to God in the vertue of his firſt inſtitution, and the promiſe made thereto, doe ſanctifie the Elements. Which words of Prayer and Bleſſing, our Saviour did not (as a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous Prieſt) murmour over the Bread and Wine, but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearely uttered them to his Father, in the hearing of the Diſciples, for their edification. The dumbe Elements have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12335:75"/> no eares to heare ſuch a voice, but are meere patients in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And therefore wee abhorre that Popiſh turning of the Prieſt from the people to the ſignes, as a baſe inchanting ceremony; fitter to worke a blind and carnall devotion in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious heart, than a ſenſible reverence and holy confidence of a beleeving ſoule. For the latter, obſerve that our Saviour begges for no inherent holineſſe to be put into the Signes, ſave onely a conveying inſtrumentall holineſſe, that the Lord would vouchſafe to uſe them to the ends of a Sacrament: that is, to make dumbe, ſeely creatures (incapable of any reall grace) to carrie reall holineſſe into the ſoules and ſpirits of beleevers, onely capable thereof? Much leſſe then did he, either by theſe or thoſe five (as they miſreckon) Tranſubſtantiate them into his body. When God bleſſed the Sabboth day and hallowed it: Did hee infuſe holineſſe into the day? Are dayes, garments, veſſels, houſes capable of inherent holineſſe? No, its enough they attend holy things: and ought therefore decently to be kept: otherwiſe neither are they holy inherently; nor yet acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and things therefore holy, becauſe there done; but becauſe they are ſo in their nature and inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>I haſten to the latter branch of his thanks. Thankes<note place="margin">Thankes.</note> is the ſecond branch of Chriſts bleſſing: And ſo of the Miniſtes act in the conſecration of the Sacrament. Wee have to note that thus it was in other bleſſings.<note place="margin">Why joyned with Prayer.</note> When <hi>Salomon</hi> dedicated the Temple, one branch of it was ſolemne thankſgiving to God that had ratified his word and promiſe,<note place="margin">1 King. 8, 24.</note> enabled <hi>Solomon</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the temple, and made good that which he had ſpoken. The aſcent of thanks is ſo great a glorifying of God, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it becomes a rich deſcent of bleſſing. And when prayer is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God without thanks, its no ſigne that the ſoule faſtens upon God for the granting of thoſe things which have bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. But our Saviour here, having had a commiſſion from his Father to ordaine the Sacrament, takes it for granted, that hee was heard by him in this his requeſt for ſanctifying thereof to his Church: and therefore, together with the prayer doth alſo here annex his thanks for anſwer. Prayers and praiſes ought ever to attend each other, eſpecially for things formerly received, that by the experience of former anſwer from God,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12335:75"/> God, our hearts might not be to ſeeke of confidence and hope for the preſent, and for time to come. For ſure it is, our ſelfe-love doth ſo ſway us in ſeeking what wee would ſtill get, that the acknowledgement of what we have already enjoyed from God, is forgotten. Nay rather, even while they pray for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God upon any of his Ordinances, or otherwiſe, it is our duty even then to give thanks, ſo farre as ws feele our ſelves to have praid in faith, and in the name of Chriſt: for faith in a manner preſenteth the thing (which we doe warrantably ſeeke) unto us: And although I grant ſuch a bleſſing may actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be denied us, yet our thankes ſhall returne (in ſuch a caſe) into our boſomes, and ſhall be accepted of God.</p>

                     <p>The third Sacramentall act of Chriſt and the Miniſter,<note place="margin">The third act. Breaking.</note> is the breaking and powring out the Bread and Wine. In the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereof, marke two things: Firſt, the order of it: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Act it ſelfe. For the firſt, Why did Chriſt firſt bleſſe, then breake and powre out? Anſwer, That he might reſemble the order of his owne ſatisfaction. For firſt he was annointed or qualified in his perſon to ſatisfie, ſet apart and ſanctified to it; and then he was Sacrificed: to have ſeparated or bleſſed them after the worke of the Croſſe performed, had beene needleſſe: and ſo, to have beene firſt crucified, ere bleſſed and called, had beene Sacrilegious. Even ſo here in the Elements; reſembling his ſeparation and death.</p>
                     <p>But for the act it ſelfe, conſider two things: firſt,<note place="margin">Two things in it. 1. What it was?</note> What was it? Why was it? For anſwer to the firſt; The breaking of Chriſt was a taking of the loafe, and a breaking thereof with his holy hands into gobbets and morſels meet for his diſciples; not minſing the bread, and cutting it with a knife into ſmall bits, nor yet into overgreat pieces, but I ſay into morſels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent. I doe not quarrell with the cuſtome of cutting with the knife: for (as I ſaid before of ſprinkling the water, ſo I ſay of this) I diſanull not the Ordinance thereby: yet ſtill I ſay, I would rather chuſe to cleave to the inſtitution in ſo plaine an act of our Saviour, if it may conveniently be done, than to balcke it. And the rather, becauſe it may ſavor of ſome Popiſh niceneſſe: For as they weare white gloves when they meddle with the Elements, and touch them not with their bare hands, pretending more reverence to be in a beaſts skin, than a mans naked hand; ſo ſome thinke it too homely perhaps to breake the bread with their hands, in compariſon of cutting it with a knife. To ſuch I ſay, that they are too nice herein; and the inſtitution of Chriſt much more to be followed; the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12335:78"/> Miniſter himſelfe breaking it, and no leaving it (as ſometimes is uſed) to the Clarke or Sexton to be done.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">2. Why was it?</note>Secondly, why was it? I anſwer, for ſundry cauſes: firſt, to parallell the Sacrifice of the Paſſeover, (a type of Chriſts Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,) which was to be ſlaine, and the bloud of it ſprinckled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſecondly, for a more meete apportioning of the bread of the Sacrament, and the Wine to the eaſier uſe of the Receivers, than in the whole loafe or flagon: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thirdly, and more principally to repreſent the voluntary offering up himſelfe the next day upon the Croſſe for an oblation to God: Elſe he would have choſen ſome other, to breake and powre out; but in doing it himſelfe, he typified his laying downe his life freely,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10, 18.</note> when as elſe none could have taken it from him: for when his apprehendors were caſt upon the earth, then did he yeeld himſelfe to their hands: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fourthly, to ſignifie to the Church, that although the Lord Ieſus were in himſelfe the fountaine of all life and nouriſhment to his Church, yet his Church could no otherwiſe be capable of him to ſuch ends, than by vertue of his being broken upon the Croſſe. He was as a ſealed fountaine before,<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> but now ſet open for the Church. This Reaſon I would have well noted. No other way, but to be broken, could make him meate and drinke indeede. The Butt of wine in the Celler hath wine of excellent quality in it ſelfe, but except it be broached, none can be the better for it. Hence the Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> cries out,<note place="margin">Cant. 1, 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou art as an oyntment powred out; in the ſavor of thy oyntments we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee.</hi>

Rom. 3.25.</note> and other the like phraſes there, <hi>Eſa·</hi> 53. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> dwels upon his bloud-ſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. ane in twentie other places; to ſhew that nothing but death could make us the better for him, either in pardon or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: No incarnation of his, no Innocency, Miracles, no Compaſſion, Teares, Love, Reproaches, Preaching, Prayers without his being broken, could make him uſefull to us.</p>

By being once broken by death, he both paid the price of wrath, and alſo became meete nouriſhment; Chriſt being made ours to pardon, is alſo made ours to feede and furniſh our ſoules with all graces of his Spirit: the Supper is ſo the Sacrament of our growth in the Lord Ieſus, as firſt hee is our growth in faith and Iuſtification, and then of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

If thou have loſt thy peace by an ill conſcience, beware thou come not firſt to the Sacrament to fetch ſtrength to returne to thy former courſe of walking with God, till firſt thy pardon and peace be renewed; that were to ſoder, not to mend thy breach: yea, it were to dawbe with untempered morter. Chriſt is firſt broken as a ſatisfier of wrath; and then as a nouriſher of a poore emptie ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Touching the ſecond, Learne to apply the Lord Ieſus broken in the Sacrament for thee, in a confident manner.<note place="margin">2 Act.</note> If hee have beene really thine, broken for thy renewed pardon, yea, the oftner the better; lay thy ſoule in the clift of this Rocke,<note place="margin">Exod. 33, 32.</note> get thy ſelfe into his wounds, and lie in his ſides, and thence ſhalt thou draw nouriſhment to ſuſtaine thee, whence thou dreweſt ſtrengh to make thy peace. This broken Chriſt, his bloud, his powring out, containes both thy peace and thy grace; and by an inſeparable union of the Spirit is given for both. Leſſe than the bloud of Chriſt dead upon the Croſſe could not ſave thee; and leſſe, than it can not reſtore any grace of his Spirit decaied in thee, as the Spirit of prayer, watching, ſoberneſſe, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſſe of heart. But if the Sacrament have revived the one, feare not, the other will follow. There is a knot of unions in Sacramentall broken Chriſt, get one, and get both: faith will teach thee how to get both; and doth ſweetly claſpe with Chriſt for welfare in both. Touching the ſubſtance of which, I ſpeake leſſe here, becauſe I ſhall handle it in the

                        </label> Onely this one thing I adde here, that the broken body and bloud powred out of Chriſt, is offered thee in this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to nouriſh thy faith in Chriſt crucified, afflicted, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for thee; that hereby thou mightſt draw ſtrength from his Paſſion, to ſuffer and overcome in him, or for him, whatſoever the Lord ſhall thinke good to lay upon thee: whatſoever then thy Croſſe be, eſpecially if bitter, weariſome, unuſuall, darke and tedious to be borne: come to the fountaine of patience and victory, the Lord Ieſus broken for thee: Hee hath overcome the chiefe dint of all croſſes, in taking the fire, wrath, and ſting of ſinne, out of thy conſcience; and this is one maine helpe to ſettle a reſtleſſe heart under deepe affliction; that Chriſt broken hath taken away guilt, and brought pardon and peace. And ſecondly, having ſo done, hee hath overcome the force of the Croſſe, and hath brought patience, ſelfe-deniall, calmeneſſe, humbleneſſe under the ſame into thee; ſo that in him thou ſhalt be upholden, endure, and beare thy yoke, not murmour, not thinke long, not uſe ſhifts; but by the promiſe ſealed by the Sacrament, beleeve the Lord will in due ſeaſon give thee beauty for aſhes,<note place="margin">Eſay 61, 3.</note> and the ſweet fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and patience, more ſweet, than the trouble was grievous. Theſe the Sacrament doth confirme and ſettle the ſoule in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if Chriſt broken bee wiſely applied and put on by faith. To conclude all, I ſay, if the Lord Ieſus Sacramentall, be a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Chriſt, for all uſes:</p>
                     <p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>6</label> Sixthly, how curſed is the condition of all ſuch receivers, as are yet to ſeeke of him in any benefit of his Sacrifice and Croſſe, Oh! how fearefull is the Sacrament to all ſuch as never underſtood the Doctrine of Chriſt broken? How ſhall they be the better for the Supper? Oh! what terror ſhould it worke in ſuch conſciences as can not by experience ſpeake one word to their ſoule of the benefit of Chriſt in either? Surely if the Lord Ieſus broken were never given them; no other benefit of his Adoption, or Sanctification, either in grace and glory can be theirs. And by conſequent, that fulneſſe of Chriſt which here is exhibited to the faithfull, to ſave and refreſh them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes by their unbeleefe as unfruitfull to their ſoules, as if
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12335:81"/> Chriſt had never dyed nor Sacrament ever beene offered them. For they are ſtill the ſame, neither good day mends them, nor bad payres them, for any pardon or grace that ever Chriſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken could yet helpe them withall. But for the third Act, thus much.</p>
                     <p>Now the fourth and laſt miniſteriall act of the Supper,<note place="margin">The fourth Act. The diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> is the diſtribution of it to the people, with a charging them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as from God. For its expreſly added that our Saviour having taken, bleſſed and broken the Elements, did give them himſelfe to his Diſciples. He called them not about him, and ſuffered them to ſerve themſelves of them, but dealt out both Bread and Cup to each of them, and ſuſteyning a double perſon both of the divider, and of the thing divided, charged them each and all to receive and apply them, as the offer of God. And to ſay truth, to what end ſerved the former acts, ſave for this laſt? Touching the ſeverall diſtribution of Chriſt, I doe not thinke that he did ſeverally give it to the perſon of each di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple immediately; but that reaching out the ſeverall morſells, he gave perſonally to them who were neareſt, and ſo by them, he conveyed it to the remoteſt ſitter, till all were ſerved. And this he did, not onely in the bread but in the Cup alſo, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth particularly mention, and ſo the other,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.21. Luk. 22.20.</note> and <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. expreſſeth.</p>
                     <p>Now in this laſt act, I conſider two things.<note place="margin">Two things heere.</note> Firſt, perſonall. Secondly peculiar application of the Sacrament. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he would intimate thus much,<note place="margin">1. For perſonall application.</note> that the Miniſter in his reaching out the Elements to each receiver, is the hand of the Father, applying the Chriſt of the whole Church, to ſuch a man, and ſuch a woman in perſon. And as each communicant ſuſteines a double perſon, eyther of memberſhip as hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the whole body, or of perſon, as he is to anſwer for himſefe to God: ſo in the former reſpect he communicates no other Chriſt than the Chriſt and head of the body: and ſo calls God our Father, and Chriſt our Chriſt, ſeeing he hath no right to any Chriſt, ſave in the Communion of Saints: By vertue of which, he approves himſelfe to be a true member of the body, clayming no right to Chriſt otherwiſe than the Chriſt of his whole militant Church. But in the ſecond reſpect, as each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12335:82"/> or beleeving receiver, ſtands in his owne place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaves ſpeciall grace for himſelfe, ſo hee calls God my Father, and Chriſt my Chriſt: and therefore comes not to receive any implicite Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.28.</note> or as the Church receives him; but comes to receive him for himſelfe in perſon, for his owne pardon, aſſurance, peace, ſupport: and ſo his owne as no mans elſe. Each Chriſtian hath Chriſt in a community, becauſe a branch cut off from the ſtocke is but dead,<note place="margin">Iohn 15, 6.</note> and the Legacy of Chriſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall is not given to a member, but to the body, that ſo it may aptly and fitly be derived out into portions. As of many graines one loafe is framed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.17.</note> and whole Chriſt is given to the whole body: ſo alſo of this loafe the Lord cuts out heere one morſell there another, for each members ſeverall uſe, which perhaps is not anothers. The arme in the body hath no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment ſave in the body, that it might learne to abide in the body,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.18.</note> and to neede it as a fellow feeling member. Howbeit, the nouriſhment of the arme in ſpeciall, is not the footes, nor the thighes, but it owne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">2. Peculiar.</note>Secondly, in this diſtribution of the Sacrament, our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus aymes at peculiarneſſe: and teacheth us, that when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter reaches out the Elements to this perſon and to that, hee doth not onely preſent a common Chriſt to become my Chriſt; he doth not onely make him my Lord and my God, and lay him in my lap, for my reconciliation and life: but alſo hee doth make him mine peculiarly, for the granting of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſupplying ſuch wants as I in particular finde in my ſelfe: without which it ſhould not availe me that he ſupplyes the wants of others. And thus Chriſt Sacramentall, is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſt, (though a Chriſt of Community) but a peculiar and ſpeciall Chriſt, cut out, divided and proportioned for each ſoules neceſſity: as many lines are equally drawne from one center, to each part of the orbe and wheele thereof.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12335:83"/> and moſt baſe, unfaithfull and fooliſh ſteward in the world, to pull away the Cup from his people, and to defraud them of that full nouriſhment which both his Father allowes them, and himſelfe was broken and ſhedde his blood to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And whereas they cavill thus, that Chriſt gave onely to Miniſters, to no lay men, and ſo they doe: But as for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (by whom there is perill of ſpilling) they doe it not, for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Sacrament. Yee hypocrites who ſtreine at gnats and ſwallow Camells, how can he bee ſecured that the wine will not be ſpilt in a Miniſters drinking it? Or who taught yee that the Church ſerves for the Elements, and not they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Church? Cares Chriſt for dropps of wine more than the ſoules of his people? Is it more with him that wine ſpill, or the ſoule periſh? Againe, where learne yee to expound the words of Chriſt (Eate yee, drinke yee all) excluſively? Doth hee not ſay, I am with you to the worlds end? Doe the Apoſtles live for ever? Saith he, Doe this as oft as yee doe it, till I come? Tell me I pray, by the ſame reaſon why may any ſave the Miniſter take the bread? is there any proviſo for them? No, no, he ſpake heere as elſewheere, in the perſons of Miniſters to all beleevers, as in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. he expreſſeth, <hi>I pray not for theſe onely, but for all that beleeve.</hi>

If Chriſt had ſo done, what had his giving of the Elements beene but a dumbe Pageant: whereas if it were the care of Gods ſtewards to conſider, that looke what they doe at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they doe onely in relation to their Miniſtry: how wiſe, ſtudious, and faithfull would they bee in that other cutting of the word, and giving it duly to the people, by ſpeciall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, applying and dealing out to each hearer his portion?

Oh! couldſt thou ſee the moſt curious wiſedome of the Lord Ieſus thy ſteward, in the diſpenſing of Sacramentall graces, neyther ſuperfluouſly, nor niggardly; neither the apparell of the growne to the young, nor Phyſicke in ſtead of foode, nor ſtrong meate in ſtead of milke, nor any of theſe out of ſeaſon, when the ſoule is paſt them and ſtarven: but theſe fully, juſtly, wiſely, tenderly, and all in ſeaſon: yea to all, ſo that the number of his people wearies not his diſpenſation. Oh! how would it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh thee! Its the ignorance of the ſtewards excellency, which makes him ſo little ſet by.

No no, the Sacrament is the hand of Chriſt thy ſteward, ſeeing thee, ſingling out thee, looking downe for ſuch as are broken, empty, baſe, and fatherleſſe, that he may bee ſtrong with all ſuch! And now in ſpeciall to thee he ſaith, Thou art this thirſty beleeving ſoule, apply the promiſe to thy ſelfe; <hi>Iohn, Thomas,</hi> ſuch a man or woman: for in a manner the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſupplies the defect of the word, both in perſonall and peculiar application. It tells thee thy name is written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: it gives thee a ticket in ſpeciall from God, to ſecure thee to be his: and as it offers whole Chriſt to the Communion of Saints, ſo it ſeveralls out thee, and tells thee that thou art not forgotten among the reſt, but to thee the Lord Ieſus broken belongs. Thou ſeeſt not the parcell of bread and wine, more perſonally offred to thy hand, than Chriſt to thy ſoule. So that as by vertue of generall Chriſt thou denieſt thy ſelfe and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>Our Father, give us this day our daily bread, forgive us, leade not us into tentation:</hi> that is, compſt thy ſelfe to ſerve onely for the uſe of the body: ſo by vertue of Chriſt cut out and divided to thee, thou ſayſt, I beleeve in God: I beleeve in Chriſt, I beleeve in the holy Ghoſt: I beleeve my ſelfe to bee the Lords, and faſten ſo upon Chriſt, not as every beleevers but mine owne in ſpeciall, to pardon, to ſave me, as if I were the onely perſon.

Doe not cavill I ſay, Oh ſuch can carry away ſuch and ſuch gifts as I cannot atteine! Why? hath not the Lord for thee as well as them? But thou ſeekeſt another mans ſupply, not thy owne. As <hi>Abſalon</hi> ſought to governe, when he ſhould have beene ſubject: ſo, thou commeſt for the gifts of ſuch and ſuch, but no ſupply of thy owne wants. What ſhould the hand doe with the gift of the head? or the foote of the hand?

They faſten not upon Chriſt their divided portion, but reſt in their complaints, laying out no money for bread. They come and goe daily as naked as ever, as if Chriſt were cut out and given there to have their cuſtome daily, and heare of their wants and needs, but to be a ſupply of none. Much like thoſe who wanting any implement in their houſe, let all neighbours know their wants, and ſeeke to borrow, but want credit, and want ſtill. Oh! its fearefull thus to profane Chriſt offred as a ſupply of every ſoules wants.

Oh! the ignorance and infidelity of moſt receivers is great in this! Nothing is ſo formall, fulſome a thing with them as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which yet is the realleſt bleſſing under the Sunne, even

As <hi>Iehojakin</hi> lifted up from priſon to the daily portion of the king of Babells meate, ſo ſhould the heareſay of a Sacrament be to thee. Thou wouldſt abhorre thy ſelfe for thy blinde, baſe and fulſome receivings, more than for thy ſwearing and drunkenneſſe.

                        <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note>Now then to end this point, if the Spirit can thus worke the heart to imbrace Chriſt by a promiſe, how much more by the Sacrament of the Supper? in which I may truely ſay the Lord Ieſus is brought forth in his likeneſſe, eminently, even in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and immediate manner of nouriſhing, all Chriſt, whole in reſpect of his obedience and death, pardon and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as a diamond not to be broken: and yet broken alſo upon the Croſſe, divided into portions, as the meete morſells of each poore receiver that needs his fleſh and blood: True bread to be her ſtaffe of life, and wine to be the cheriſher of her ſpirits. Oh! the bringing forth of theſe flagons, in ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a manner, to affect all her ſoule, and to overthrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, muſt needs be a more effectuall inſtrument of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to perſwade her, that Chriſt is all in all unto her, for her ſupport in grace and holineſſe, than eyther the word alone, or any other ordinance. The Lord having in ſpeciall ſet the Supper apart, neyther to bee a breeder at all of grace, as the word preached is, nor to be a nouriſher in an ordinary manner,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12335:88"/> as other publique or private meanes, in each of which Chriſt conveyes himſelfe &amp; his communion to the ſoule: but an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance onely tending to nouriſh, ſerving for the nonce, and to no other purpoſe, and therefore having no other ſcope, muſt needes be moſt effectuall for the end it ſerves for. Each thing is moſt prevalent in her owne predominancy and Element. If then the ſpirit ſo can worke by the promiſe alone, how much more by the Sacrament which repreſents that which it offers under the ſhaddow of the ſignes? and tells the ſoule,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20, 27.</note> Behold the print of the nayles, behold my ſide, behold my ſelfe, heere is my body, heere is my blood given for thee, ſhed for thee:<note place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> Be not unfaithfull, bue faithfull. Sooner ſhall bread and wine ceaſe to nouriſh thy body, than my fleſh and blood to nouriſh thy ſoule to eternall life: The concluſion is, the Spirit doth more eminently convince the ſoule by the Supper, of her nouriſhment by Chriſt, than it can by the Word alone, for as much as the Sacrament with the Word is above the Word.</p>

Then doth the Supper nouriſh the ſoule in that. Firſt in the mortifying and quickning power of it; for the Lord Ieſus broken, and powred out, affordeth the ſoule daily ſtrength to breake the chaines, the power of ruling and defiling luſts: ignorance, errour, ſecurity, infidelity, profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſelfe-love, unrighteouſneſſe, intemperancie.

Yea more, it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Spirit and frame of the inner man, with fuller bent of reſolution, and ſtreame of heart and affections, to be for God, and to goe in the ſtreame of obedience to him. Secondly, it quickens and nouriſheth the ſoule in the ſpeciall graces of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, wiſdome, watchfulneſſe, humilitie, love, feare, faith, patience, mercy, and all holy affections, and gifts ſerving to holineſſe.</p>

Then doth the Supper nouriſh that grace: take ſome inſtances. One eſpeciall grace of inward converſation, is the life of faith in all eſtates, in all duties, meanes, and graces. The Supper then ſtrengthens this life of faith, in all theſe, enabling the ſoule to be more ſober in proſperitie, more humble under the Croſſe, more fruitfull in well doing, more diligent and conſcionable in all ordinances, more effectuall and plentifull in graces. Another inſtance may be of outward converſation, ſtanding in marriage, liberties, calling, company, ſolitarineſſe, the tongue, the governement of the family.

See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, ult. where the Apoſtle joynes theſe two laſt branches: <hi>Be yee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooveable and ſetled, alway abounding in the worke of the Lord.</hi> Wee ſee it in plants and men: The plants muſt be well ſpread and rooted in the earth before they can grow fruitfull, at leaſt in plenty. A little roote will not nouriſh large branches and boughes: Sometime the root is ſo bare and fleet, that it will ſcarce furniſh the tree with leaves; but a large, deepe root hath many ſtrings, and little ſuckers, which worke for the tree, and feede her with nouriſhment; ſo that the roote abiding deepe aod faſt in the earth, the fruit is plentifull. Wee know nature is never more fruitfull in the active principle of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than when the ſtrength of the body is well confirmed. So then, this is the laſt ſtep of ſpirituall proſperitie, when this fourth is added to the three former, to wit, fruitfulneſſe in a good courſe. And it is the perfection of that influence and communion which we here enjoy in the Lord Ieſus our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. <hi>That meate indeede, and drinke indeede,</hi> is this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and fruitfulneſſe; When out of the abundance of the heart, the tongue is fruitfull in uttering, the hands in working, the feete in walking, the members in ſervice, the whole tree in bringing forth fruits of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Eſay</hi> 61, 3. calles ſuch accepted, and beloved of the Lord; as we eſteeme excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly of bearing trees, eſpecially if yearely and plentifully. It
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12335:93"/> is from the roote of the Lord Ieſus, that the ſoule doth grow thus fruitfull. The indwelling of Chriſt, is the abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: the leſſe of Chriſt the ſoule hath, the leſſe ſap and fruit; the nearer the communion, the greater the influence. The greater the treaſure is from which a man draweth, the richer the ſupply. We ſay, Its ſweet to take from a great heape. An heape wil ſerve for all uſes: a poore unſtockt man is eaſily perceived in his wares, the ſmall ſtore and choiſe therof: hee that hath little mony to lay out, is bare in his houſehold, attire, family, diet; ſcarſe hath for neceſſitie, but nothing for delight and plenty. So is it with a man that is no proſperer in grace, hath only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to mouth; he cannot verifie our Saviour his ſpecch, <hi>That out of the abundance of the heart, he bringeth good things abundantly:</hi> but rather he is ſcant in good ſpeech, ſcant in preaching (no more than needs muſt) in hearing, prayer, meditation, barren and poore: ſo in the graces of the Spirit; little love, ſmall humility, compaſſion, ſo in duties, ſo in meanes. Alas, the roote is bare, and therefore the tree is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull.</p>
                     <p>So alſo the deeper the ſoule is rooted in Chriſt;<note place="margin">Chriſt it this roote of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Iohn 11, 3. and 12, 1.2.</note> the larger roome he hath in the heart, the more ſcope and entertainment he finds, the greater graces he affords. If we compare <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha's</hi> houſe with the houſes which now and then Chriſt was bidden too, no doubt but wee ſhall finde, that his fruits of preaching, love, converſe, miracles, and good doing, were more fall in the former than the latter. Why? There was no ſtop, he might be ſure to be welcome at all times: therefore hee ſhewed himſelfe more there, than elſewhere. Chriſt then the more he is rooted in the ſoule, the fuller hee is of influence, and ſo growes more fruitfull. For, what is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe? Surely when a Chriſtian being aſhamed to conſider what a barren heart hee hath had under full meanes; and how little and narrow the good is which he hath done for God, to himſelfe and others; and beholding the cauſe thereof, his want of true ſtocke of knowledge and faith: mourneth for this his miſery, and ſeeking for an heart fuller of Chriſt and his nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, doth from his treaſure extend himſelfe plentifully to the exerciſe of ſuch graces, meanes, and duties, as may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12335:94"/> to himſelfe, and in the communion of Saints. If a poore ſhopkeeper almoſt banquerupt, be ſet up, and holpen up againe with new ſtocke, what will hee doe? Ply the matter, runne to London, furniſh himſelfe with the beſt of wares, and choiſe of them, bring them home, fill his ſhop in every corner; and ſatisfie the turne of every buyer. Oh! what a change is there?</p>
                     <p>So it is with a Chriſtian recovering out of a fruitleſſe courſe by the Lord Ieſus his raizing and ſetting him up againe, ſtores himſelfe with plentie of graces, ſets them on worke, and fills each part of his life with duty; yea, ſets himſelfe againſt his former unprofitableneſſe: Adding to his knowledge, faith, to his faith love, meekeneſſe, patience, experience, hope: that ſo he may not be unfruitfull in the Lord Ieſus.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1, 1, 5, 6.</note> If he have riſen up well apaid in his morning awaking, he reſts not there (as before) but fetches from his treaſure a cheerefull heart to his calling: from thence proceeds to family duties and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from thence to doe good, and take good in company, thence to be well occupied alone, thence ready to viſite the ſicke, to admoniſh, to comfort, to adviſe others, and when all is done,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15, ult.</note> to nouriſh in himſelfe the life of faith one while, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe another while, forbearance, long ſuffering in prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; thanks for bleſſings, patience if croſſed: ſometime in one, ſometimes in another duty; yet neither hurt by one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor glutted by ſucceſſion of ſervice, but fruitful &amp; unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in all, with one eye to his ground, another to his end.

Now wherin is the Lord Ieſus ſo full a nouriſhment as in his Supper, in which he brings forth all his ſtore and Magazine to fill the ſoule that is empty

Oh! they are healthy and proſpering, they diſcredit not Gods diet, are not meager, evill favoured, ſurfited with ill humors, pride, eaſe, the world, revenge, hypocriſie. This Phyſicke and Diet of Chriſt broken and crucified hath given corruption her deadly bane (more or leſſe) in point of reigning and deluding, and defiling them: they loathe to decline from Gods truth, and the power of it; the wayes of ſtarters and revolters, and time-ſervers, are as vile to them, as drunkenneſſe or uncleanneſſe: They hold their own towars God in ſome poore ſort, and this pulſe of God (as its counted, although indeede reſtorative) fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, is made fleſh of their fleſh, and runs in their veines, and miniſters vigour, ſpirit, and life, unto them, to keepe them in Chriſts body, in the midſt of all the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and declenſions, and coolings, and curſed examples of this world. Secondly, this Supper of the Lord Ieſus, battens and makes them thrive in grace, makes their grace more, more ſavory, better qualified, enlarged in meaſure, more humble, meeke, patient and heavenly, than when they firſt beleeved: This grace of the Sacrament heales them of an hide-bound heart, dead and ſtale, weary, and ready to ſtand ſtill in grace. Every Sacrament addes a little of Ieſus Chriſt his tallneſſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12335:96"/> thickneſſe, depth, and makes them increaſe in favour with God, in credit with his Church, to reach further than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did, and to be enlarged in holy abilities for God and his Service; loathing to ſtand ſtill, as much as to bee quite dead.</p>

Therefore bee not diſcouraged: God is like a tender mother who hath both ſtrong children and weake, ſhee hath meate for them all: But if any one be poorer and weaker than another, that ſhall have the deintieſt: not that it may ever looke to lye upon her hand: But that being cheriſht by her cordialls, it may grow ſtronger, and be free from ſuch maladies. Therefore in Gods feare, if there be truth, and a mourning heart for faylings, and hunger after the beſt meaſures of grace which Chriſt hath for thee: let not this view of doctrine diſmay thee. Encourage thy ſelfe to wayte for pardon of old defects, and the Lord ſhall by that I have ſayd, rouze up thy ſpirit to an earneſt coveting and a true enjoying of ſuch welfare in Chriſt as thy heart longeth after: Deſiſt not thy diligent receivings, and holy, humble preparing of thy ſelfe; for if thou leave Chriſt (as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſayd when thoſe carnall followers departed) whither ſhalt thou go?

                     <p>But heere ſome may ſtep in and ſay, yea, wee ſhould have hope of this if onely we had ſome defects and decayes in grace and goodneſſe: But its worſe with us: for we have harboured our corrupt qualities of ſloath, eaſe, deadneſſe, yea, perhaps, a proud, uncleane, covetous heart: yea rebellious againſt many knowne truths of God: ſinned againſt his mercy by much preſumption, againſt his threats by ſecurity, againſt his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by contempt and diſobedience: our hearts accuſe us of coldneſſe, ſelfe-love, unthankfulneſſe, forgetting of Gods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, wearineſſe of the yoake of a ſtrict walking with God, and counted it preciſeneſſe; taken the uttermoſt of our liberties: counting them our enemies who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved us: And now loe, the Lord arraigning us at the Barre of juſtice, we are confounded in our ſelves, and almoſt driven to deſpaire: when our conſciences doe riſe up againſt us, and

The Spirit of God ſhall not ſuffer you to runne from God with ſuch full bent of heart, but your checks, and cumbats, working with the experience of mercy and former pardons ſhall revive the ſeede of God within you: So that yee ſhall not wholly ſhake off the ſpirit of regeneration: The grace of your Baptiſme ſhall be as a ſecond boord after ſhipwracke to recover you; and ſhall ſend you to the Supper with hope of regayning that light and comfort which your revolts have darkened and eclipſed: elſe ſhould the Sacrament be of no power to ſuccour diſtreſſed conſciences in their relapſes; But this I adde, ſuch ſhall finde it hard to binde up their breaches, and wiſh they had never revolted.</p>

Its not urged, extorted by force on your part (although if yee went from ſea, to ſea, to get it, it were cheape on the price) but freely, and of mine owne accord, given, when it could not be expected; with a moſt plaine, beteaming heart, meaning as I ſpeake, not to deceive, nor defraud. What doth faith? Lord farre be it from me to warpe from thy meaning, I enquire no further, I conſent and take it. Laſtly, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exhibiting it.<note place="margin">6.

                     <p>Vpon the Promiſe depends the charge. For marke,<note place="margin">The 2. Act Obedience of faith.</note> the Lord addes, Take it therefore, eate and drinke it. Why? becauſe its ſo qualified for thee, and ſo neceſſary, that thou canſt not take it, but thou ſhalt proſper and be happy; thou canſt not refuſe it, but thou muſt needs pine and periſh; Therefore I who by promiſe have thus drawne thee, doe alſo by my Authority Command thee. I know many thinges (as excellent and weighty as they are) yet are not eſteemed, becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; Therefore I who know them better than thou, doe require and charge thee upon thy Allegiance, Take, eate and drinke this my body and blood, that thou mayeſt proſper and fare well. What doth faith? She obeyes the command, and ſaith, I doe ſo Lord, I take them as thou commandeſt. I concurre with thy command as with thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

                     <p>The latter work of faith,<note place="margin">2 Branch. Application of faith.</note> is the application of the grace offered unto thy ſoule, for the gaine thereof. When thou haſt beleeved the promiſe once, doe as hee who hath bought

Branches.</note> into every faculty and member of thee. Faith in relation to Chriſt, in the ſupper, may bee compared to the Nouriſhing ſoule and her naturall faculties in man, and that in foure particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Faith Sacramentall reſembles the ſtomacke in the body. The ſtomack we know ſo takes the nouriſhment,<note place="margin">1. By the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</note> as that it unites it to it ſelfe and alters it in the property, that it may become her owne, and beginne to looſe it owne forme, that it may put on a new. Till the ſtomacke have thus held, cloſed and digeſted the meate, lo, it may bee voyded up againe. This is the firſt worke. Faith takes the Lord Ieſus, and cloſes, with him puts him into the ſtomacke of the ſoule, digeſts him there, unites him to it ſelfe, ſuffers him not to depart away from her as he came, but holds him, makes him hers, and alters him in ſome degree for her owne Nouriſhment. When the hand takes Bread, fleſh, drinke to put it in the mouth, lo its true meate in it ſelfe, but not the bodies as yet: but if the ſtomacke have once layd it in cloſe, lo, it ceaſes to be bread and fleſh, and beginnes to bee the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, and to undergoe a due change that it may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bee the bodies food. The Ivy doth not ſo cloſe with the tree, or the Miſle to the Appletree, for her owne end, altering the juyce for her owne uſe, as faith Sacramentall, alters Chriſts body, blood makes it another, turnes it into matter prepared for her ſelfe. Faith truely ſaith, by vertue of the ordinance and Spirit of the ſame, loe, This body is mine, my meate, I lay claime to it: this blood is mine: All the grace of the Sacrament is mine, I clare not leave it behind mee, for its given for mee, as meate for the body. And as the ſtomacke cloſes with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12335:103"/> meat as her owne, ſo doth faith with the Lord Ieſus, for why? By as due right this nouriſhment is hers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, faith is like the naturall Appetite in the body:<note place="margin">2 By Naturall Appetire.</note> wee know ſuch is the Nature of that facultie in the healthy and ſtirring, that there is alway a paſſage from the ſtomack to the veynes; and ſo the appetite is cleare, the ſtomacke kept cleane and fit for continuall Attraction of new nouriſhment. So is faith in the ſoule, it holds the ſoule in ſuch perpetuall holy motion: and paſſage of old nouriſhment; that it is alway healthy, and empty and open to receive in new. Perpetuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of nouriſhment, prepares her appetite to new refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſoule that is deſirous of meat by ſtarts and fitts, is clogged, and makes not away with the former: but when the uſe of nature hath conveyed one meale away, and ſpent the ſtrength of one; lo the veines grow very attractive and pinch the ſtomacke to covet more, and to bee in perpetuall appetite. Faith is the ſtirring work-man, or houſ-wife in the ſoule, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurfited with humors, or clogged ſo with diſtempers; but that ſhee retaines ſome ſweete appetite after new refreſhing. Otherwiſe Chriſt yeſterday, to day, and for ever, would grow fulſome and weariſome with her: but by this meanes the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is in continuall health, and temper; ever ſending forth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for new dueties, occaſions of the heat and life, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever capable of new nouriſhment with delight. Hence it is, that though the meat bee not much, which ſhee takes, yet ſhe thrives merveilouſly: and a little in an haile ſtomack goes a great way? how much more then when hunger makes her feed fully?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly faith is like the great carrying veine in the body,<note place="margin">3 By the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying veyne,</note> from the liver the fountaine of blood and nouriſhment: and to the ſmal veins in the extremities of the members. For as the one derives the blood into each part by a proprietie of nature ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributing the maſſe into ſeverall parts, according to their variety of ſubſtance and need: ſo is it with faith, ſhe comes to the maſſe and full heape of blood and nouriſhment, ſhe finds an hoorde of fulneſſe in Chriſt; and there faſtens her pipes and veine of conveyance; and thence ſhe carryes to the uſes of the ſoule whether for bleſſings, a ſober thankfull heart: or for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:12335:104"/> croſſes, an humble, meeke, beleeving, and confident upon the promiſe of Chriſts protection: heer ſhee layes in grace to rule her ſelfe well in marriage, then in family, in hearing, in prayer: heer ſhee catches at grace to reſolve her doubts, to bane her corruptions, to better her conſcience, to comfort her in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe: none comes amiſſe; as the need and meaſure of each part requires, ſo ſhe drawes and derives, from Chriſt, her wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption. And looke how the diſtribution of nature, doth by ſecret inſtinct derive meete juice for each part, not that to one which is the others due: but the tendereſt to the moſt fleſhly, and the viſcous or courſe to the ſtiffer, as muſcles and joints: ſo is it heere, the derivation of faith is wiſer than of nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">And the veines of laſt concoction.</note>Secondly, having ſo done, the leſſer veines neereſt to each member to bee nouriſhed, by the heate and concoction of it, doth turne this proper nouriſhment into the ſubſtance of the nouriſhed, that both may be one; and this is the eminent worke of faith alſo; that turnes the Lord IESVS, into the beeing of the ſoule ſpiritually: it doth not only carry meet juice to the part, leaving it there unapplyed; but makes the meat and the member one. The Lord Ieſus by faith dwells in the ſoule, inhabites it, is one with it, bone of her bone, and fleſh of her fleſh: and by his owne ſtrength prayes, heares, meditates in her: by his owne ſtrenght, patience, love, humilitie, puttes an influence into her for the like; ſo that of his fulneſſe the ſoule hath grace for grace: yea <hi>Eſay.</hi> 26, He doth all her works for her, and in her: hee is afflicted and ſuffers with her, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in her, and ſhee ſayeth, <hi>Now live I, yet not I, but Christ in mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, faith is like the naturall ſoule her ſelfe in her Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">4. By the Natural ſoule.</note> for as wee ſee men well fed, are fit for worke; ſo is it here. Faith exerciſes the grace of the ſoule, received from CHRIST Sacramentall, in the ſeverall paſſages of life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning each mans calling. Looke how it is with ten men that have bin wel fed at one feaſt, although they have 10. ſeveral workes to doe, yet they go cheerfully about them; the plowman to toile, the Merchant to project, the Scholler to his ſtudy, the traveller to his journey; the workes are ſeverall, but the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12335:104"/> ſame feaſt affords ſtrength and cheere of body and ſpirit, to each of them, for the menaging of his taske; even ſo,<note place="margin">1 Kings 19.8.</note> in the ſtrength of this cake and water, this Lord Ieſus his body and blood, the refreſhed ſoule goes about every lawfull ſervice which the Lord calls her too: One hinders not another; But there is enough in Chriſt to fulfill all, and to fit each for his taske. So that, if he be put on well as the Apparrell; lo, in the warmth and comfort of it, the ſoule is ready to goe from duty to duty, from her riſing, to her lying downe; who of her ſelfe was good for nothing. And thus ſhe boaſteth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> boaſts of the Lord; and ſees that as her ſelfe cut off from him, is as the branch that withers, ſo all her ſufficiency is from God; and as the ſea ſends forth al, l waters, and receives them, ſo doth the Lord receive from faith the honour of his al-ſufficiency: Theſe few things may ſerve for a draught of this Truth, how faith Sacramentall applyes Chriſt to be her Nouriſhment, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken him in the Promiſe.</p>

Let it be thy appetite, thy ſtomacke, thy veines, thy ſoule, to draw, to unite, to diſtribute, to aſſimilate, and to convey Chriſt into all parts of thy life. Lin not till his ſubſtance be thine. If thou hadſt a ſundry friend to furniſh thee with ſundry boones, thy want would ſend thee to them all: To the Lawyer for direction in thy ſuites and troubles; to the Phyſitian for thy diſeaſes; to the rich to borrow monies; and perhaps for neceſſitie, to a Divine, in trouble of minde: Count the Lord Ieſus all. If a poore man be asked why he makes ſuch a trade of it, to frequent ſuch an houſe: He will ſay, Its a full houſe, its not deere, to trouble it often. To be ſure, here, to this ſtore and wel-ſpring; the ofter thou come (to the Supper I meane) the welcomer. If his fulneſſe can make thee emptie, know all thy emptineſſe cannot robbe him of fulneſſe. Beleeve that thy neede can not amount higher than his fulneſſe: and ſo long thy pipes are ſure to be filled. But come in faith, and bring a free heart, and an emptie bucket, and be to him, as he is to thee: Come to hm to cloathe nakedneſſe, to pay debts, to rid thee of chaines; and let there be no fulneſſe in him, whereof thou feeleſt not neede, and then as the Sacrament is appointed to thee for ſpeciall growth in godlineſſe, ſo ſhall the Lord Ieſus become unto thee; and thou ſhalt not be the firſt ſervant that ſhall bring in a falſe report of Chriſt, for an hard maſter to thee, as hypocrites doe.

                     <p>One point ſtill remaines: Namely,<note place="margin">The ſecond act Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall of the people. Eate, Drinke. The meaning of it.

By Eating, enjoying the benefite, or delighting the ſoule in the fruit thereof, according to thoſe Texts. <hi>Of the fruit of thy labour thou ſhalt eate. Pſal. 128,2.</hi>

                        <hi>ye have no life in you</hi> (where eating is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for beleeving) but as here, for enjoying. So then the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſt Sacramentall, is, That ſpirituall enjoying of the Lord Ieſus, and all his good things which we have received; to beare our ſelves as well apaid ones at his feaſt, and ſuch as are filled and ſatisfied with himſelfe, deſire no better condition count our portion to be fallen into a good ground; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon our ſoules what we have found at his Table, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce therein as in ſpoiles, and he have our ſelves as thoſe who have beene keeping holiday in his houſe, and feaſting in the Mount (not of <hi>Sinai</hi> or <hi>Horeb,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) but the Goſpell, <hi>Eſay</hi> 25, 8.<note place="margin">Eſay 25.8.</note> and therefore we having that we came for, be as we would be; and poſſeſſe our ſoules with exceeding compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and contentment, and enlarge them to the Lord with joy and thanks, rejoycing in him, as <hi>Mary</hi> ſaith, our Saviour, and God all-ſufficient.</p>

Nay even of the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt liberties I may ſay, there is no ſafetie in them; for there is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12335:106"/> a ſurfeit in them, either to body or ſoule: Wine is an mocker, and ſtrong drinke is a deceiver; there is a hooke and a ſnare underneath; in the iſſue they bite as a Serpent. Too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is not ſafe; it ſurfeits, and kills: even as feaſts of great plenty breed diſeaſes, and make worke for the Phyſitian. The unſafeneſſe of the beſt thing, makes it imperfectly contenting; But the feaſt of Gods corne, and oyle, and milke, (as it coſts nothing) <hi>Eſay</hi> 55, 1.<note place="margin">Eſay 55, 1.</note> So a man may feede on them without feare; as in Verſe 2. <hi>Eate good things, and ſpare not:</hi> curbe not, nor put a knife to thy appetite, the more the better; no ſurfeit is in them. Let thy ſoule delight and ſatiate it ſelfe in this fatneſſe, there is no hurt in it. Not ſafe onely in reſpect of Gods leave and warrant: as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, Drinke of thine owne wells, thou art truly intitled to them in him whom all things are thine by: But thou ſhalt never heare of them after, for any danger they can doe thee.

                     <p>Secondly, theſe Dainties Sacramentall are pure and meere,<note place="margin">2 Their Pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> uncompounded, and without the mixture of carnall delights. Sweet is that of <hi>Salomon. The Lord gives the righteous a portion, and no ſorrow with it.</hi> Hee meanes, there is no checke of an ill conſcience in it; as commonly in worldly contents there is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the perſon, or by the things; either the uſer is none of Gods, or the things are ill come by, and impurely uſed. But here is neither impureneſſe of perſon or of things; each are pure to other, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.<note place="margin">Tit. 1, 15.</note> whereas the conſcience of the impure is defiled. Hence it is, that this mixture marres the feaſt. As wee ſee in <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> jollity, there wanted no mirth,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.4, 5,</note> but the Lord cauſed ſuch an horror to fall upon it, by that handwriting, that all the joy vaniſh'd. As he in the Fable, who all the while he was feaſting had a naked ſword (hanging by a briſtle) with the point downewards, hanging over him. As once one ſaid (when he had ſhewed a friend all his Treaſures.) But what if a man ſhould goe to hell with all theſe? When <hi>Haman</hi> had related all his contents to <hi>Zereſh</hi> and his friends, he addes,<note place="margin">Eſter 5, 13.</note> Yet all theſe doe me no good, when I ſee <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſitting in the Kings gate.

                        <note place="margin">3 The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe.</note>The third perfection is their fulneſſe. In all other contents there is a ſcantneſſe, in reſpect of the number, that men have not enough of them: If men of poore become rich, then they want pleaſures; if both, then they want honour to make their content full. So they ſtrive ſtill for an earthly Paradiſe, which is loſt,; and when they have all yet their ſoule hath not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: But theſe dainties have a fulneſſe and comprehenſion in them, able to ſatisfie the ſpirit; there is an equalneſſe in them thereto,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.25.</note> both are eternall. The heart hath enough, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid when hee ſaw the Chariots; and although it longs after more for meaſure, yet it findes reſt and quiet, even in the kinde of the things which are perfect in their nature. When men take money in a market, or for their rents, ſtill they like that they love, but yet they want, and there is an hole unſtopt: the barren heart cries as the grave,<note place="margin">Prov. 30.16.</note> give, give: and why? ſave, becauſe they have not enough; yea, though they had enough (for a mediocritie is enough for a ſober minde) yet becauſe there is not a qualitie of content in them, their increaſe workes no full ſatisfaction. A man that hath ſpending money enough, wants a ſtocke, another hath money to buy him one ſute, but hee wants for change: or he hath enough to buy one of cloth, but not of velvet; or if he have that which will ſuffice for appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, yet conſidering that children, diet, ſutes of Law, and friends, call for more expences; that he hath joyes him not ſo much as that he wants: So are all the fulneſſes of this world, they have a ſcantneſſe: not unlike to a coate made ſcant, which comes not over the wriſts or knees or boſome, but leaves them bare. But this nouriſhment and fulneſſe of Chriſt is as is deſcribed, in every kinde, and a full ſupply, as I noted before, and eſpecially, out of <hi>Revela.</hi> 3.16. by an enumeration of all things for uſe and price.<note place="margin">Revel. 3, 16.</note>

When folkes go to Pageants, and enterludes, oh! how they are tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? How they could ſpend dayes in them? But when all is done, they are al a-mort. As I have heard of ſome beſotted Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, who were not able to ſubſiſt, when their games and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings were over: &amp; therfore ſo laid the matter, that the end of one ſhould beginne the other; till at length with rotten bodies,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12335:107"/> and waſted conſciences, and emptie purſes, and tired ſpirits, they fell dead over their cups and games. Alas, though this were a prodigious, yet not a perpetuall laſting; and yet ſuch a one as made themſelves laſt but a while. But lo, the things of this feaſt are durable meate, drinke, riches and honour. No wonder they iſſue from a fountaine, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.13.<note place="margin">Ier. 2, 13.</note> not a broken pit: A Fountaine (we know) though it be but a fingers deepe, yet outlaſts a lake that is up to the middle; the one payres with uſe, the other is fed with a Fountaine. Durableneſſe in kinde, and durableneſſe in ſucceſſion, is great perfection. If a man could buy cloth which would laſt all his life without wearing, and yet daily weare better and better, oh, what a market would he thinke he had? when thoſe fading and blaſted crowns of Lawrell and Wormewood are withered; mens gaines, feaſts, brave clothes, games and companies: then the garland of a Chriſtian made of <hi>Semper-vivum,</hi> not the herbe, but the grace of the Sacrament, ſhall flouriſh and ſurvive upon the heads of the beleeving receivers; and when ſome of them blaſt at their death, yet they ceaſe not till another crowne of immortality ſucceede for ever, and ever.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12335:109"/> alſo in all duties of both Tables) and the fruits of this faith, I meane the graces of hope, love to the Saints (the partners with us in this communion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, 2.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16, 2.</note>) and patience, humilitie, courage, thankfulneſſe; and the reſt, of which I gave a touch before in the point of fruitfulneſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, walking with God, daily, as being under his eye, awfully, purely,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.22.</note> and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, approving our ſelves to him in the way of our life: making his Word our delight in both the promiſes, commands, and threats of it; and ſo holding the Lord in our ſight, as loth to forgoe him. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Aſcending in our thoughts from our owne welfare in private, and forcing our awcke hearts to the ſervice of our time (as <hi>David, Act.</hi> 13.36.<note place="margin">Acts 13, 36.</note>) as well as looking that it goe well with our ſelves, (of which ſelfe-love our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is full ſtuffed, except this grace ſcoure it out.) Remember we, that the gaine wee get by Chriſt in his Aſſemblies, ſhould preſſe upon us the bewailing of the loſſe thereof, <hi>Zeph</hi> 3.18:<note place="margin">Zeph. 3.18.</note> the beſeeching God to eſtabliſh the Lord Ieſus, and to ſet up his King upon his Zion, in the power of his Ordinances, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Throane of Satan and Antichriſt, that the Scepter of Chriſt may prevaile every where againſt Popery, Atheiſme, Ignorance, Blinde devotion, profaneneſſe, and forme of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, in an heavenly heart, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 18.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.18.</note> knocking us off from below, moderating our liberties for us, enlarging us to deſire his glorious preſence, to have communion with him as he is; concluding, that if theſe treaties with him at diſtance (as in the Supper) be ſo ſweete; then much more to eate and drinke it in his kingdome, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 16.<note place="margin">Luke 22.16.</note> Oh! if our treaſure be there, let our hearts be ſo alſo, and ſend we them before us, in token wee looke to remove thither as our abiding place. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, 1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.<note place="margin">Phil 2, 1, 2. 2 Cor. 5.1.</note> Thus doing, wee ſhall uſe the Supper for the end which it was given for, to ſupply the abſence of the Lord Ieſus from us, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 35, 16, 17.<note place="margin">Luke 22.16.</note> till wee may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let that good we have got out of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">The third, imparting our ſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> ſo plentifully abide in us, that wee impart it to others. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe graces is ſuch; not to feede on them alone. When thoſe Leapers, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7, 12.<note place="margin">1 King. 7, 12.</note> had filled themſelves in the Aramites tents, with ſtore of all things, their hearts ſmote
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12335:110"/> them, for ſtaying there ſo long: and they reſolved to haſten and tell the King and people of it, that were ſterven in the citie. So ſhouldſt thou: The Sacrament, is called a communion in this reſpect as well as the former. Poore birds if they light upon ſcattered corne, call their fellowes to the heape. When <hi>Sampſon</hi> had found honey,<note place="margin">Iude 14, 9.</note> though hee kept the riddle, yet he imparted his honey to his Father and Mother. The benefits of Chriſt are not of a ſecret and private, but diffuſive nature: Let us bee aſhamed to conſider that other things in the world are ſo perfected by communion, that neither Trades, Artes, Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes and faſhions, nor any other thing, have cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, but the matters of Chriſt are now at the bareſt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: Why? ſave that thoſe that ſhould excell in them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale their skill and experience. The Communion day, ſhould be our exceeding day, and as in feaſts, ſo in this, we ſhould ſend (or carrie) portions, and acquaint others (wiſely and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) with our lot, and receive from them like intelligence. And thus much for the ſecond generall head, viz. The grace of the Supper. I conclude with the laſt.</p>
                     <p>And that is the particular end of the Sacrament, viz. The ſealing unto a beleeving ſoule,<note place="margin">The third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.

I will adde but a little for the applying of the gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rall, to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Deſiring the wiſe Reader, to looke backe, and make uſe of what I have ſpoken of this ſealing worke in generall, and to apply it here in ſpeciall to the ſealing of the growth, as alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I have ſpoken in Baptiſme of the ſealing of our Birth, or Regeneration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">A needfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion to ſhew the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Spirits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note>And, that my Reader may retaine the ordinary view of the two ſealing workes, this briefely let mee ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, that the Spirit of Grace is given by God, to attend each Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, both the Word of Promiſe, and the Seale of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and that to this end to worke perſwaſion in the ſoule, and to cauſe it to beleeve the things that are given her of God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Then ſecondly, note, The object of this perſwaſion by the Promiſe is double, and therefore the object of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Seale is double: Firſt, perſwaſion of the ſoule that ſhee is truly the Lords, truly called, regenerated, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:12335:110"/> borne of God. That is to ſay, reconciled to him, and renewed in him. Secondly, perſwaſion that ſhee growes in the grace of the new birth, and ſhall grow as a lively member of her head, till ſhe receive the fulneſſe of that part. That God is the Author of both perſwaſions, appeares by the two maine heads of unbeleefe, which formerly I noted to reſide in the ſoule. Firſt, that ſhee dare not beleeve at all, that the promiſe of mercy reacheth to her. Secondly, that ſhe dare not beleeve that ſhe ſhall ever reach to any further degree of ſanctification than ſhe preſently feeles. Both theſe the Lord in his double perſwaſion confutes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third thing is, the Spirit therefore applies it ſelfe to both theſe; (yet not alway in one and the ſame meaſure of perſwading, but) according to the neede or proportion of each part. By the Promiſe of the Word, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it workes more, ſometimes leſſe perſwaſion, as ſeemes beſt to himſelfe: and ſo, by the Seale of the Sacrament, hee doth likewiſe, worke weaker, or ſtronger aſſurance: For though there be a perſwading power in an high degree in both, yet the Spirit is no ſervant to his Ordinances, but his Ordinances to him: they ſhall perſwade more or leſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as that power of Chriſt which the Spirit diſpenceth, is more or leſſe conveied into the ſoule, by his perſwaſion. He is never ſeparated from promiſe or Seale, according to the meaſure of his working by both. But that is as he liſteth; for he bloweth where and how farre hee pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, note, the chiefe and maine perſwaſion of the Spirit in the Word, is the Spirit of the ſealing Promiſe, and the chiefe work of the Spirit of perſwaſion in the Sacrament, is the Spirit of the ſealing Sacrament. And therefore as the Seale with the Promiſe, is above a promiſe alone; So the Spirit of the Seale with the Sacrament, is above the Sacrament alone; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the ſealing power of the Sacrament is above the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power of a Promiſe: the Sacrament being (ordinarily) the inſtrument of working the ſoule to the higheſt aſſurance which it can enjoy in this world, whether of the truth of her regeneration which Baptiſme, or the growth therein, which the Supper ſealeth and perſwadeth. Sealing is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſwaſion, and Sacramentall ſealing, the higheſt ſealing.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:12335:111"/> We doe not limit God to his Sacraments, but (ordinarily) we ſay, he limits himſelfe in this kinde. Laſtly, I adde, the moſt apt way to get the perſwaſion of the Spirit in an higher mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is to hold cloſe to the lower meaſure. As in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the beſt way to get the perſwaſion of the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is to cleave to the bare naked word, and truth of the Promiſer for himſelfe. So, the next way to compaſſe the beſt meaſure of ſealing perſwaſion in the Sacraments, is to come unto them with faith in the perſwaſion of a promiſe: for marke; the Spirit in multiplying perſwaſion, doth never loſe the former meaſures, but holds them ſtill as grounds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. He that can now ſwimme without bladders, yet retaines the skill he got firſt by them: and he that makes true Latin of his experience and art, yet forgets not his Rule, by which he firſt attained it: ſtill the power of the bladders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in the man who ſwimmes alone: and ſtill the power of the Rule is in him who of himſelfe doth ſuddenly ſpeake true Latine: Even ſo the promiſe ſtill abides in the ſeale of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the perſwaſion of the ſealing Spirit, although it be above a promiſe, yet it is not without it, but holds the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cloſe. Even as the ſeale and delivery, and ſeaſin of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, is above a Covenant, yet never without it, but alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, and adding a ſuperiour ſtrength (which it had not before) of perſwaſion and aſſurance.</p>

Firſt, if the Sacrament of the Supper hath this end, to ſeale the aſſured growth of the ſoule in grace; let it be terrour for two ſorts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Papiſts, who pervert the end of the Sacrament to baſe helliſh ends of their owne; of which before. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, profane ones; who come in their ſinnes: who turne the Table of God into the table of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels: yea turne the ſeale of the grace of Chriſt, into a Seale of Gods Curſe, into gall, poyſon, and the water of triall of the Adultereſſe. The Sacrament is not given thee to beget thy ſoule to God, but to nouriſh it being begotten. When then thou commeſt to the Supper, bearing the Lord in hand that thou art the Lords; Lo, thou calleſt for vengeance, if thou be an unregenerate one ſtill. Thou ſaiſt in effect, Lord, let this Bread and Wine be my bane if I belong not to thy
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12335:111"/> Covenant. As ſhee that durſt drinke the water of jealozie, knowing her ſelfe defiled, implied her craving the rotting of her wombe: So I ſay to all ſuch: If they come not hither for the right end of God, they cannot chuſe but come for the wrong: either for the better, or for the worſe. A ſeale it muſt needes be, no man can hinder it, yea to a covenant: if not to the Lords, then to ſuch a covenant as they belong too: that is, a league with hell, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. a league with their luſts, adultery, pride, &amp;c.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving treated hitherto of the Doctrine of the Sacraments (wherein the uſe of Baptiſme was urged) it now remaineth that wee come to the exerciſe of the Supper of the Lord:<note place="margin">Entrance.</note> Whereunto this ſecond Treatiſe ſhall ſerve (if God will) and wherein, (ſomewhat more largely) the Doctrine of our Preparation to this Sacrament ſhall bee propounded: The rather, ſeeing it was the chiefe ſcope of the Booke it ſelfe; and which occaſioned at firſt, the former Diſcourſe. That ſo the religious Reader might in one view both underſtand what a Sacrament is, and how to be received. Concerning which, I purpoſe to deſcribe what this preparation is; and then in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to deſcend to the branches whereof it conſiſts, with the uſe and application thereof: and ſo with ſome directions and caveats at the end, to conclude the Treatiſe.</p>

                     <p>Sacramentall Preparation and Triall, is a duty required by God,<note place="margin">Deſcription of Sacramentall preparation.</note> at the hands of all and every that deſire to receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; by the due exerciſe whereof a man may diſcerne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no he be qualified to receive; and accordingly either proceede to Communicate with comfort, or elſe deſiſt for the preſent, till better prepared. I will briefly touch upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verals of this deſcription,<note place="margin">Six branches.</note> which are theſe ſix. Firſt, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betweene Preparation and Triall. Secondly, that Triall is a Divine command. Thirdly, the Perſons who are to try. Fourthly, what the due exerciſe of trying is. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the different ſorts of religious ſearch, and how this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall ſearch differs from them. Sixtly and laſtly, the end and ſcope hereof. The ſecond and fourth of theſe I reſerve to the laſt place, as moſt eſſentiall to the duty. Touching the reſt in their order I ſhall firſt ſpeake a little of them, and ſo of the two other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and triall differ.</note>And firſt, let none cavill at my differencing Preparation from Triall. I know well that they agree in one, and that the former word uſually is taken for the whole Triall of a Communicant. My meaning by it is, to ſhew what a man who would try himſelfe aright, is to doe, ere he ſet himſelfe about the worke. That is,<note place="margin">Preparation is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> to bring himſelfe within ſome ſuch compaſſe as may fit him the better to cloſe with a triall of himſelfe. Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſequeſter himſelfe from other buſineſſe and objects of the world and his calling, that he may do but one thing at once; but alſo to call in, and to calme his thoughts and affections, ſo that he may be himſelfe, and gather up his looſe garments, and gird the loynes of his ſoule to do this maine worke well; that is, with a cloſe, reverend, and intent purpoſe of heart. <hi>Salomon</hi> hath a ſweete ſpeech,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.1.</note> 
                        <hi>For a mans deſire he will ſeparate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> that is, lay aſide for the time, all other buſineſſe, and thoughts of leſſe conſequence, that he may doe the maine thing to be deſired,<note place="margin">Mat. 13, 44:</note> in a more due manner. And when the Merchant had found the Pearle, he is ſaid to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; that is, to go apart and to weigh well the worth of that he had found. And in the ſtory of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the holy Ghoſt uſes this phraſe of preparing the heart to ſeeke God; noting that to ſeeke God either in the worke of Converſion, or in any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12335:118"/> ſervice and ordinance, requires a ſeparation of the ſoule from the uſuall affaires of the world, which diſtract the minde from weightier objects. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of the foole, ſo it may be ſaid of moſt men, (who yet thinke themſelves wiſe) <hi>Their eyes are in every corner of the world;</hi> that is, ſo buſied and hurried about a thouſand vagaries and fancies abroad, that they are no where leſſe, than where they ſhould cheefly be; in the meditation of heavenly things: Hence that complaint of moſt, that meditation is ſo difficult to them; others, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories are ſo fickle, becauſe they divide and cut themſelves (as <hi>Martha</hi>) into many peeces,<note place="margin">Luke 10. ult.</note> who ſhould rather unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cloſely into one; and becauſe they have ſtuft and fraught their mindes and hearts with ſo manifold thoughts, and have ſo many irons in fire at once, that one hurts another; as in the crowding of a multitude at a ſmall wicket, (at which one by one might enter eaſily) we ſet its long ere any one can well get through.</p>

Perhaps all are not ſo groſſe, as once one was in his ſaying Grace before meate, who brake off uſually in the midſt, to bid his ſervant to ſet his diſhes aright; but ſurely the ſinne of moſt men is great in this kinde: Except God will take them as he findes them, deepe in their buſineſſe, and over head &amp; eares in other matters, he muſt pardon them for Triall at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for indeed they have uſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to ſuch a courſe, that either they muſt defile Gods worſhip with their own vanities, pleaſures, profits; either they muſt ſerve God and Mammon at once, or not at all: they never knew what an empty heart meant, unloaden of her uſuall thoughts and affections, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for God, ſerious and withdrawne from it ſelfe; They count it impoſſible to attaine to it.

To have ſome few wandring thoughts after God, to caſt in a word by the way, of religion; to heare a chapter read in the clutter of houſhold buſineſſe, is no worſhip; for that requires a ſeparation. There is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired alſo; but without this, nothing can be done. The hand which will compaſſe Gods Altar muſt be cleane alſo: But firſt it muſt be empty; if it be filled with nutſhels and traſh, it can hold nothing elſe. If we cannot ſo much as heare a ſerious ſtory, or indite a letter without privacy; if we can do no choiſe worke well, except we be ſolitary and ſerious: do we thinke it eaſy to worſhip God in a Fayre, a Marquet, an Alehouſe, a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, while we be working, or playing, or prating, or drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? No, all our courage, all our ſtrength is too little; a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, humble, beleeving heart is little enough for it: Therefore at leaſt an empty, a ſwept, and voyded heart is neceſſary.</p>

We muſt know, that as the gold weights will not try gold till they ſtand ſtill; ſo neither can the ſoule try her ſelfe till ſhe be well ſtayed and poyſed. When we will powre any precious liquor into a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or glaſſe (eſpecially if it have a narrow necke) we will ſet it in a ſteddy poſture, for feare of ſpilling. No man can ſee any thing in roared waters. As the Lord Ieſus ſpeakes of agreeing with our adverſary, that we muſt lay downe our ſacrifice by the Altar the whilſt,<note place="margin">Math. 5.25. 1 Pet. 2.2.</note> and do that chiefly; and as <hi>Peter</hi> bids thoſe who will covet the milke of the word, that they purge out of their ſtomacks all ſuperfluity; ſo eſpecially doe it in this Triall at the Sacrament. Its manifeſt by mens cavils againſt this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (viz. that they have callings to attend, and buſineſſe to looke after, and they cannot prepare themſelves) that, I ſay, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it as a veniall offence to be thus cloyed with other cares; but if it defile and deſtroy Tryall of thy ſelfe, how can it be ſmall? Thou wilt ſay, thy thoughts and affections are neither

Let it therefore be as odious unto thee, to carrie a light, a gadding, unſavory heart about thee, ſo full of other bables, that Gods liquor muſt needes runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: I ſay, to be out of frame alway to entertaine the beſt things, Let it be unto thee as odious as very profaneneſſe it ſelfe. And before thou venter upon triall, clenſe thy ſelfe of this fulſome glut: and doe not enterline or write Gods letters upon a blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but cleane paper, even as thou wouldeſt wipe thy Table-booke, ere thou writeſt the Sermon.

                     <p>Touching the ſecond point, viz, The perſons whom this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all concernes, it hath two branches, Firſt, how many, Secondly,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12335:120"/> Who muſt try? For the former, it may ſoone bee anſwered: All muſt try and examine,<note place="margin">Perſons. 1. How many?</note> againſt the Sacrament. The charge is generall, admitting no exception. As it was to the Iewes for the Paſſeover, that all who eate it, muſt be liable to the rules of obſerving it:<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> ſo muſt it be in the Supper, none can bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Tryall,<note place="margin">None exempt.</note> who will have a part in the Sacrament. Briefly (not to ſtay the Reader long) He that hath not a ſoule to ſave, to thrive, to proſper in grace, or to be happy, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it: He that neither cares for the loſſe of heaven, or woe of hell;<note place="margin">See Exod. 12.43.</note> he that abhorres the name of a child, and ſo the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his fathers houſe, and the portion of an heire; he that chooſeth rather to be without among dogges and ſwine, hee that hath cut off himſelfe and is become an Heathen and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane, a ſcorner and paſtgrace, let him exempt himſelfe; elſe the Lord exempts none at all. Pearles indeed muſt not bee caſt before ſwine, elſe it is not the difference of any outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that can diſcharge from this duty. All need the benefit of it, all are in danger to incurre the loſſe by neglecting it: all therefore are equally obliged to it. The people cannot exempt themſelves under colour of inability, or not being booke lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; they muſt not put it off to the Miniſter as more ſufficient for it. The Miniſter may not exempt himſelfe from it, as if he leſſe needed it than the people: Schollers are not free, becauſe their calling is to ſtudy, or reade the Scriptures, for they may be farre from the triall of themſelves: Such as have learned the doctrine of the Sacrament ſoundly, muſt not waſh their hands of it, becauſe of their knowledge. The wife muſt not thinke her ſelfe to be tryed in her husbands carefull tryall, as if ſhe were but his ſhadow, and hath him to anſwere for her; much leſſe the husband may quit himſelfe upon hers. The rich muſt not plead liberty by his great buſineſſe; nor the poore for lacke of leaſure from his handy labour; nor the aged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their infirmities growing upon them: not the more experienced, becauſe they have oft done it; nor the novice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is greene, and new to begin: not the travellor, becauſe in a journey: not ſervants, becauſe they are under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others; nor governours, becauſe they have authority over them: No, there is no Time, Age, Perſon, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12335:120"/> againſt the Lord of heaven; Prince and people, learned and idiots, Iew, Barbarian, bond, free, great or ſmall, are all alike and under no difference with him; But all of all ſexes, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſtates and relations, (if men, if Chriſtians, if of capable yeares and diſcretion) ſtand bound to this Sacramentall triall. He who will exempt himſelfe, let him bring forth his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore let all covers of figleaves, drawne from the variety and difference of outward reſpect, fall to the ground, as unable to hold water, when God ſhall enquire who they are that dare take out their names from this generall rule; Gods lawes are not as cobwebs, onely to catch ſmall flyes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond branch is, Who muſt try? To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Branch 2.

And againe, a ſly hypocrite, who can accommodate himſelfe to the opinions of men, and occaſions of things very cunningly, may procure the conceit of a very honeſt man; But conſcience well informed will beare witneſſe without coſenage or error, what a man is. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Thirdly, it is conſcience which is the do-all in the ſoule: Shee is ſet by the Lord to be the eſpiall of the narroweſt paſſages of the heart and life, (except hood-winked and defiled,) ſhe keeps the (cinque ports, the out-lets and in-lets of the heart and life, nothing paſſes without her notice and verdict; that water which runnes by the mill of our courſe, utterly unknowne to

And that men ſhould hang other mens triall of them, as a Cover of darkenes before their eye, that they might not come within themſelves?

                     <p>Onely there is difference betweene the triall of others and our owne. The triall of others, ſerves as the materialls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a building: <note place="margin">Anſwer. No.</note> our owne triall, is, as the building of the workeman himſelfe. When all the Timber, Brickes, and Lime is ready layd: the workeman muſt finiſh the frame. The Saw or Axe may be layd upon the ſtone, or upon the timber: but except the lively hand of a man doe acts thoſe tooles duely, there will be no ſawing of them in two. So is it heere: The miniſter or governour muſt give light and direction how to try, wherein it ſtands, and how the falſe heart ſhould bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: hee may teach, upon what termes ſearch is to bee made, and what not: he may remove falſe ſcruples, error, and letts: But the verdict of triall muſt bee thy owne in ſecret when all is done. As at the Aſſyſes, there bee two Iuryes, the one of Inqueſt: the other of life and death: There is aſingular uſe of the former, and yet that meddles not with the finall ſentence. Onely it makes an eaſie way for the finall, and remooves rubs, and gives light, what bills are to bee enquired upon: and ſo the other conſults and gives verdict of life or death, guilty or unguilty. So here let the uſe bee, to admoniſh all cavillers and profane perſons, who would take advantage of the rule, to try themſelves: and all to exclude the helpe of others, whom they ſhould ſhunne, leaſt their ſinne and profaneneſſe ſhould be perceived. There are none who ſo decline the helpe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but thoſe who abhorre to try themſelves, and ſo at once would rid their hands of all. But oh wofull wretch! Wilt thou neither try thy ſelfe, nor take advice of others? If thou wert under arreſt for debt, and ſome of thy friends would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſurety for thee, wouldſt thou chuſe wilfully to goe and rot in riſon, rather than to be beholding for their love?

                        <note place="margin">3. Generall. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>The third branch followeth, which concernes the difference of this Triall from others; and that from theſe words; (Whereby a man may diſcerne himſelfe to be qualified to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reive.) I will digreſſe as little as may be; but my aime is, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch ſomewhat in this point, which may give light to that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12335:122"/> which followeth, and to ſhew what may helpe to the better triall of a Communicant when hee comes to the Sacrament; alſo how a Chriſtian may without confuſion apply himſelfe to each ſervice of God, in the due manner and kinde ſeverally. Firſt,<note place="margin">Diſter.</note> this Tryall and preparation differs from the Triall wee ſhould premiſe to other Ordinances, as hearing the word, reading, praying, faſting, family duties, &amp;c. All which require a preparing of the ſoule to ſeeke the Lord:<note place="margin">1 From other Ordinances.</note> yet in there reſpects they differ: Firſt, in that all other (for the moſt part) although they doe require an eſtate in grace, ere they can pleaſe God: yet ſo farre as they doe conferre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the converſion of ſuch an one as yet wanteth grace, and muſt therefore be uſed upon paine of rebellion againſt God: therefore they doe not abſolutely require that ſtrict tryall, which the Sacraments doe. True it is, thoſe who heare, pray, faſt, conferre, being deſtitute of faith, ſinne in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing: yet ſince the Lord hath alſo ordayned them to be inſtruments of begetting faith it ſelfe: therefore its alſo a ſinne to neglect them, although a man bee unqualified to uſe them holily. But the Sacrament is of another nature, being no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance appointed for the breeding of grace, but of nouriſhing it onely: ſo that he who dares to come to the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet out of covenant,<note place="margin">Double pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</note> profaneth it both in matter and forme. Therefore the cloſer Triall is required unto it, above others. Againe, in the Sacrament the Lord is not ſpiritually and virtually preſent, but even viſiblely and ſenſibly appeares to his people in the ſignes of the ſubſtance, matter and forme of his covenant: both our reconciliation, and ſanctification. A good ſubject ought to preſent himſelfe at each Court and meeting of Iuſtices, Seſſions and Aſſyſes, with due regard and reverence, as one that dares not breake the peace, nor be a bad ſubject. Howbeit if the King doe ſend for him perſonally in his owne ſight, to tender and renue his oath of Allegiance, it behooves him to put on a more awfull, and reverend loyalty than before. So here, every ordinance is ſacred and hath the Lord preſent in it: But the Sacrament exhibits him in a more reall, neere, and familiar manner, even as if the Lord Ieſus came corporally in preſence, to eate and drinke with us, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12335:123"/> to preſent us with his owne fleſh and blood to feaſt us; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the approach thereto, our triall muſt be more cautelous and ſolemne.</p>

There is a Legall triall belonging to the unregenerate, by which by ſoule laying it ſelfe in the ballances of the law of God, feeles her ſelfe weighed downe by ſinne to hell and deſtruction. There is a tryall of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whereby a loaden ſoule, finding that the Lord offers her eaſe and pardon in Chriſt, upon the due preparations to faith, and actuall beleeving the promiſe, doth try her ſelfe about the worke of theſe, that ſhe may partake the benefit of Chriſt. There is a penitentiall triall, by which a beleever having fallen from God and broken covenant,<note place="margin">2. Penitentiall.</note> ſearches himſelfe and caſts up his gorge that he might by pardon of his revolt, returne to God, and recover himſelfe to former grace and comfort. There is alſo an ordinary and dayly tryall of a Chriſtians courſe and walking with God:<note place="margin">3. Ordinary walking with God.</note> by which hee watcheth to himſelfe and to the rule and living by faith, and obeying God, viewing his practiſe dayly, and keeping holy quarter with God, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion moves him: Theſe all differ, each from other, and all from Sacramentall triall; Not that they are excluded from it (for they are neceſſary antecedents to it) but yet they faile in this ſpeciall reſpect of a Sacramentall triall; which lookes at this, how the ſoule may be qualified to communicate.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Revel. 3, 4.</note> that they ſhould be clothed in white, for they were worthy; he doth not mean they were worthy to be ſo clothed; but being ſo clothed, they were worthy: that is, the Lord having cloathed them with the Robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Revel. 19, 8.</note> (the linnen of the Saints) they were worthy ones in his account: So contrarily, the unregenerate are unworthy, becauſe they are naked ſtill,<note place="margin">Revel. 3, 17.</note> and care not to bee covered with this garment: And why? They know not (or will not know) that they neede it. Now then, as the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver is worthy, becauſe he is ſo accounted in Chriſt, and his preparation is accepted in him, and the want thereof is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: ſo the bad is unworthy, becauſe his perſon is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and therefore whether he prepare himſelfe, or no, he is the ſame; for out of the Lord Ieſus hee cannot be worthy. The Summe is, not the preparation of a man (in it ſelfe) makes him worthy: But the imputing of preparedneſſe by faith: and this workes an high eſteeme of the Sacrament, and a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to be a meet Communicant: neither whereof the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly can be partakers of. This by way of Digreſſion.</p>
                     <p>To returne then: The duty of triall is commended by God.<note place="margin">Proofes of it.</note> And this appeares by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 11, 28. as alſo by good Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Paſſeover, applied by the Apoſtle to us. For the former, <hi>Paul</hi> concludes the direction for receiving well, and cutting off all abuſes: <hi>Let a man therefore examine himſelfe, and ſo let him eate:</hi> Hee had told them before what Chriſts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12335:126"/> inſtitution was: But as if knowledge alone of the pure ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were not enough, he addes further, Let a man therefore examine: q. d. Although the meere obſerving of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were enough to cut off the abuſe of your love feaſts: yet, for the avoyding of all other corruption inward aſwell as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I command from God, Let every man examine. He doth not meane, let him if hee pleaſe, as leaving it to mens choyſe: but the word is imperative, let him, that is, I enjoine him: As, let a man abide in the vocation wherein God hath ſet him: let a man ſo eſteeme us as the diſpenſers of grace &amp;c. That is, I command him ſo. Neither is this as one of thoſe tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry counſels, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith hee had no warrant from God expreſſely: This ſaith not the Lord, but I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it is one of thoſe, of which hee addeth, This ſay not I, but the Lord. And the connexion of this 28 verſe with the 20. evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: For I deliver unto you, that which I received of the Lord, &amp;c. And he ſubjoyneth, let a man therefore examine, &amp;c.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Further proofe.</note>Nither doth this reſt onely upon this text; but upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of the Paſſeover, whereto this ſucceeds. Its manifeſt by the Scripture that there was ſpeciall Preparation of them that ate the Paſcal Lamb. For not only the Lord required the Lamb it ſelfe to be weaned off from the damme 4 dayes: to teach the people in all that ſpace to weane themſelves from thoſe ſweet breaſts of their worldly delights, and lawfull liberties; but he required them alſo to keepe another feaſt of unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread ſeaven dayes; wherein all leaven whatſoever, was to be ſwept out from their houſes, and Sacrifices to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for expiation of ſinne, and uncleaneneſſe, that ſo they might not come polluted to the Paſſeover. And thoſe two Paſſeovers of <hi>Hezekia</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſijah</hi> prove it:<note place="margin">2 Chro. 20. 2 Chro. 23.</note> where ſpeciall charge is given to the Levites and people to ſanctifie themſelves and each other: although for the ſpeedineſſe of receiving, there could not be ſuch legall clenſing, as the Law required; and ſo alſo, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the King firſt purged out Idols, and defaced their groves, and abandoned all will-worſhip ere they came to the Paſſeover. What betokened this, ſave the triall of their ſpirits, much more, purging out all Idols of the heart, ſweeping out
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12335:126"/> the leaven of corruption from within; without which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had beene bootleſſe. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in that place doth preſſe the ſame, though not Sacramentally, yet univerſally, ſaying, <hi>Let us therefore keepe the feaſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</note>

Elſe the world is full of curious heads, and profane hearts, to outface and outwran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the Ordinance. Men have no joy to ſuch a taske as they feele to pinch their ſpirits, and preſſe upon them any power of practiſe; and therefore (although they are ready to caſt the cords, and breake the bands of the moſt convinced truths; yet the more mannerly way is to queſtion the charge it ſelfe. And hence are thoſe uſuall interrogatories, How prove you that any man hath to doe with mee when I come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Or, how proove you that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes to us as well as the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to try our ſelves?

Or how know yee that God will have us preach and heare twice upon the Sabboth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique? Or, that a man is bound to pray by himſelfe, or twice a day in his family? Or that it is againſt nature for a man to weare long haire?

The truth is, never did Satan ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure thoſe maine truths of the Scripture, in Popiſh darke times by turning all into curious queres of things leſſe pertinent; as now, he doth in this light of the Goſpell ſeeke to alay, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12335:127"/> diſanull the power of truths by profane cavillation. But I ſay ſtill both to the one, and to the other, Its well that God hath ſo punctually declared himſelfe in his Word as hee hath. All that are not wickedly nice and curious, will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeeld to thoſe probable deductions from Scripture, which ariſe by conſequent, for the beating downe of our own baſe ſpirits, and rejoyce in ſo doing, becauſe they argue for God; than whet their leude and prejudicate wits and ſpirits upon the divels whetſtone to cavill againſt truths received: nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here at one, and there another, till they have defaced their beautie and grace, and ſo expoſed them to the utter contempt of themſelves and others; Stop your mouthes therefore oh ye carpers at Gods preciſe rules, and play not the Proctors for the divell againſt God, leaſt he pay you your fees little to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Stoope rather to the Lords Canon in all things. And you to whom this yoke of triall at the Sacrament is ſo heavie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the Lord will not leſſen or lighten it for your ſake: labour ye to be eaſed of the divels yoke of a profane carnall heart, and turne your ſwords into mattockes, deny your ſelves, get the Lord to change your minds and wills, that ſo his yoke may become ſweete unto you. And as the Prophet tels thoſe Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who asked him, Why may not we goe to good Witches about our cattell,<note place="margin">Eſay 8.20.</note> or things loſt, &amp;c. <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtomony;</hi> let that be your touchſtone, that wil aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don both all will-worſhip on the right hand, and all profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on the left. If theſe give ye no allowance, know there is no wiſdome in your witchcrafts, nor in your cavilling defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: So here ſay I, Goe to the charge of God, that will convince both Popiſh triall, and tell you, that there is no Religion either in faſting before the Sacrament (although I do adviſe no man to eat) nor in not ſpitting at the Sacrament, that much more wil confute all profane contempt of triall of our ſelves: let God ſpeake, and let all men be liers, both left hand profaneneſſe, and right hand ſuperſtition muſt fall before the Ordinance. Oh! if men be ſo buſie againſt the practiſe of goodneſſe, when there is a rule to controwle them, what companions would they bee, if wee wanted it? Howbeit even by this they ſhew that the dutie is divine, becauſe elſe their curſed ſpirit

Concerning which, firſt, I will lay downe ſome reaſons why the Lord requires this triall in both reſpects.

                     <p>The Reaſons are theſe three. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>1</label> Firſt the plaine charge of God importeth it. For the word here uſed by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">The difficulty of this triall. 1 To diſcerne hypocriſie. from ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> is not a word which aimes at ſome defect in the meaſure of our grace onely, as the triall of light gold may be diſpatch'd by weights which any man may uſe: but it eſpecially ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth triall of ſubſtance, and ſoundneſſe of mettals, ſuch as onely the Goldſmiths skill can finde out: the Touchſtone and the Fornace onely can trie gold, or ſeparate the ſilver from the droſſe. Even ſo, its not a common skill nor eaſie worke to diſcover the ſoundneſſe or falſehood of the heart in matter of grace, There is nothing more hard than this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11, 14.15.</note> Satan and Hypocrites can transforme themſelves into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of light; and make men to think them ſo. And the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and depth of the heart, and the ſelfe-love of it in eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving our ſelves to be that wee would be, and yet are loth to be, is unſpeakeable. Nothing more eaſie than to pray for ſuch things as indeed wee would not have, if God would give, becauſe then our hearts and courſes muſt be changed; and yet wee thinke wee pray aright. Nothing more eaſie than to looke upon our ſelves in our outſide of duties and performances, and reflect an opinion thereby, that wee are true worſhippers. No grace, but a falſe heart will counterfeit: and the depth of the heart is ſuch, that there is no ſhew of meekeneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, tenderneſſe of ſpirit, thankefulneſſe, love of Gods people, but a bad perſon may accommodate himſelfe unto,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12335:128"/> and act a part therein. The ſoundneſſe of the heart is very hard to diſcerne.</p>

                        <note place="margin">2 To diſcerne ſoundneſſe where it is.</note>Secondly, although there be ſoundneſſe in the heart, yet it is not alway diſcernable. As it is not eaſie to finde a Pearle in the dunghill, nor a needle loſt in ruſhes; ſo, its hard to finde out a little truth of heart and faith, when they are ſo covered and mixed with abundance of droſſe. Beſides, it is no eaſie thing, (although a man finde them) yet to walke conſtantly with God in the practiſe thereof.<note place="margin">3 To diſcerne our not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of grace.

Its hard to improove the things wee have heard and learned, and to bring them forth in due ſeaſon; they are to ſeeke with us, patience, when wee are provoked: faith, when wee ſee no likelihood of Gods hearing or anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our prayers, and ſo of the reſt; as it is with tooles ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome uſed, ſo there growes a ruſt upon the gifts of God in us, for lacke of watchfull improovement. Sloth, and eaſe do fret into us as a kanker, and creepe ſo inſenſibly upon us, that they marre us ere wee be aware. The Talents of God which wee have received, become unprofitable in us. The greateſt part of the duties we do, is not the leaſt of them we omit: in the uſe of meanes and Ordinances, formality, and commonnes, unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, unſavorines defiles us: and the life of faith in croſſes, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, duties, is very poore and wanzing in us. It were endleſſe to ſpeake of all.<note place="margin">Or in our outward courſe.</note> Now if it be ſo hard to trie our grace, how much hard to trie our whole courſe, in which the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe of our hearts doth tire us ſo, that the errors thereof in ſo manifold parts cannot be reckoned; as the ſinnes of our ſingle eſtate, or married ſtate, our callings, dealings, in the world, lawfull liberties, company, ſolitarineſſe, with other innumerable occaſions: wherein as it is hard to ſurvey our ſelves diſtinctly; ſo its as hard to watch to our rule unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riedly.<note place="margin">Much more is it hard to trie our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, if the triall of our grace be ſuch, what is the triall of our corruption? Who can perceive the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

How ſecretly doth Satan and luſt creepe in (as ſleepe to one warme in his bed) even to an honeſt heart ere it be aware? By what fine ſlights is it at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, either becauſe it is but one, or ſmall, or ſoone ſhaken off? And having once entred, how doth it defile the conſcience? When once the tenderneſſe and ſenſibleneſſe of the ſoule, (which is the Sentinell) is gone: how ſoone doth ſinne grow upon it, and increaſe? That whereas at firſt it ſeemed a great thing to attempt, now it ſeemes little, to goe through with it: and that which ſeemed little, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as nothing: till at length it foulds up the heart in ſelfe-love and careleſſeneſſe, and growne to a cuſtome and falling ſickneſſe, that it is a great difficultie for a man to picke out an end in this confuſion of eſtate, or to know where to beginne or where to end.

                     <p>But here a willing heart would faine know the properties of this triall,<note place="margin">Properties of true triall.</note> and when he hath duly tried himſelfe. For anſwer to which, although in the Chapters following, this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare better in the objects of triall: yet briefely I will note ſome workes here generally concerning all the particulars, and ſo come to the uſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, then let thy ſearch and triall be wiſe,<note place="margin">1. Wiſe.</note> and according to knowledge. Let the Law and Teſtimony be the Hammer, the Fornace, and Touch, to trie thee in all, both thy heart and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12335:129"/> life. This will informe and in ſtill ſuch skill and diſcerning into thee, that nothing ſhall lightly paſſe thee without, both notice and due verduict: Thou ſhalt neither by looſeneſſe of heart judge evill, good; nor through blindneſſe, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion, thinke good evill. This will let in light to thee to behold all things in their lively coloures as they are. The Goldſmith will not eaſily be gulled in the triall of gold or ſilver. So if thou carrie this light and torch into the darke corners of thy heart, few either ſinnes or graces ſhall eſcape thee. Elſe, thy owne falſe light, erronious judgement, prejudice, precipice, ſecuritie, defilement, and the like, may ſoone deceive thee. And ſo thy triall may proove like <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> his newes, idle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuzed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let it be ingenuous and filiall:<note place="margin">Filiall.</note> Doe not thinke that the Lord onely enjoynes thee to ſearch out the evill, and let the good paſſe: The triall of Gods people is as well of their vertues and graces, for their encouragement, as of their corruptions to their humiliation And yet, let it alſo be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall. So abhorre a ſlaviſh heart of baſe feare cauſing thee to harpe upon the jarring ſtrings of thy diſtempers: That yet thou much more loathe ſelfelove, to applaude thy ſelfe in any of thy corrupt and vicious habits or actions: But rather be as willing thy errours and evills be diſcovered, as thy graces. The true triall of a Chriſtian is a middle betweene both extremes. The moſt uſuall of the ſecond, is the latter. Fewer offend in the other; and yet their danger is as great, becauſe the true roote of triall, is the witneſſe of a good conſcience, teſtifying that there is grace at the heart, which a ſlaviſh triall denieth to it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it muſt be very inquiſitive and narrow;<note place="margin">3. Narrow and cloſe.</note> not hoverly and ſuperficiall. It muſt not be like the maſhes of a net made to catch great fiſhes, and letting paſſe the ſmall. For both the good things and the evill are cloſely and deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couched in the ſoule; Curſory triall will not ſearch them throughly. Graces are as coales raked up in the aſhes, and appeare not eaſily; or as a little corne in a great Chaffe heape. And corruption is as the core of a diſeaſe lying in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12335:130"/> and as <hi>Gehazi</hi> his booty throwne into cloſe corners. If the King ſhould ſend a Commiſſion to a true ſubject, to ſearch Ieſuites, or Prieſts in a great houſe: they would take a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row courſe both by belaying, and ranſacking the inner paſſages and roomes, for feare of eſcape or lurking: Sacramentall triall ſhould bee ſuch. Not as the ſearching of friends houſes, whom wee very ſparily and generally looke over, or give notice before to remoove out of the way that which wee are loath to eſpie. But as a man would ſearch the houſe of his enemy: And as wee reade that the Papiſts were wont to ſeerch for the Martyrs, in all places, likely or unlikely, yea, even the heapes or reekes of corne, and the haymowes, with forkes, ſwords, ſpits, and ſpeares. So ſhould we doe our ſelves, as Searchers very glad and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to finde what they ſeeke. And to this end, our triall ſhould bee punctuall and painefull. By punctuall, I meane particular and perſonall,<note place="margin">Both in pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualneſſe.</note> either graces or corruptions; which moſt naturally and generally accompany thee. And therefore Chriſtian ſearch beſt attends Chriſtian Prayer and watch: looke what thou obſerveſt to peſter thee moſt uſually, either in thy ſpirit, or in thy courſe, that take note of, and make a Calender of it. Forgetfulneſie and confuſion of memory doe much hinder triall. Note therefore both what ſinnes runne in the ſtreame and frame of thy life; and what ſpeciall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils beare ſway, and are moſt ſelfe-putting forth; and then the reſt will follow alone; and yet paſſe not by the leſſer: ſeeing thoſe which are but of a ſecond degree doe oft diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe us, while wee are bent onely to marke the moſt prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ones; and ſo by ill cuſtome are unſuſpected. Few men there are in whom ſome maſterly ſinnes doe not beare rule, pride, ſelfe-love, worldlineſſe, or the like, to poiſon their courſe. Secondly, let it be painefull:<note place="margin">And paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</note> The iſſues of good and evill are as a ſpring of ſeven heads. A laborious ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched will therefore open them all, and take himſelfe trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in all: ſearching, the ſpirit within, the tongue and members without, and fetch in matters of humiliation from the triall of marriage, ſingle eſtate, Duties, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, company, ſolitarineſſe, liberties, callinges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12335:130"/> and actions of common life. So much of the third.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it muſt be faithfull<note place="margin">4 Faithfull.</note> and loyall, that ſo all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſtartingholes, and cunning deceites of the heart may be found out; for ſelfe-love and falſehood will elſe bleare the eye of the wiſeſt. Bribes corrupt the wiſe; but not the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Sinne is a bribing miſchiefe, it labours to overthrow ſearch and inqueſt, that ſo it may eſcape the jury. But as a good Iuſtice, in taking the examination of a fellon, or rioter: will not bee gulled with each colour or faire tale, but will ſearch to the quicke, and drive him out of his trickes, and lay him open, becauſe hee is for the King; ſo ſhould our triall be faithfull, becauſe it is for the King of heaven. Its for his honour; and yet alſo for our comfort to be true to the Lord and our ſelves: Elſe wee ſhall finde as wee binde, and the Lord will be froward with the froward,<note place="margin">Phil. 18, 25,</note> and ſubtill with the ſubtill. The Sacrament will not afford that peace to the falſe, which it will to the faithfull; with the true, honeſt, and plaine, the Lord will bee good and plaine. If ſweete, gainefull, or naturall corruptions bee ſo incorporate and beloved, that wee are loth to ſearch them out, and (like <hi>Laban</hi>) ſearch every where,<note place="margin">Gen. 31, 34, 35</note> ſave where our <hi>Rachel</hi> ſits upon her Idoll; the Lord will leave us to our defilement, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the fruit of our triall. Now that our triall may be honeſt; obſerve two things: Firſt, nouriſh tenderneſſe of conſcience and uprightneſſe. Ofttimes many a ſecret evill of ſmaller conſequence may annoy ſome man, even a glance of the heart, or eye; when as a groſſer evill will not touch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Its not eaſie for one that hath his glove on his fingers to take up a needle or a little pinne, which the naked hand will eaſily doe. The tender eye will water and twinckle at a mote falling in it, as if ſome great hurt befall it: and the weazand will ſtreine at a gnat. Secondly, be willing to take any helpe which may further thee in thy ſearch. Sometimes a faithful friend who obſerves thee; a ſtander by may ſometimes ſee that which a Gamſter ſpies not, Sometimes it will not be amiſſe to ſee and reade thy owne triall in the booke of a Croſſe; for each Croſſe hath her ſuperſcription, and will either tell us what
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12335:131"/> grace the Lord would try, or what ſinne he would correct; yet I ſay, the beſt trier is our owne conſcience and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>

Search out in thy ſelfe, either thoſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces which are moſt like to further, or thoſe evils which are in directeſt oppoſition to a comfortable receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The Sacrament is a moſt ſpirituall communion with God; ſpirituall evils will moſt choke it, as infidelity, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, apoſtacy, unthankfullneſſe, falling to the creatures: let theſe and ſuch like be moſt purſued.

You boaſt much, that ye have received to day, and eaten your maker (as the Papiſts ſay) but ye have eaten and dranke your owne bane and poyſon.

Hee who approved the juſtice of his owne will, that ſinne ſhould be puniſhed; yet puniſhed them (<hi>Iudg.</hi> 20.20.) even them who went about it, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as guilty. The queſtion is not about the doing of the duty, but the right manner of it. So I ſay to theſe, that Gods Sacrament be received, is neceſſary. But who are they that are fit for it? God hath no ſuch neede of Sacraments, that he cares not how they be received: But moſt righteouſly hee urgeth the duty, yet puniſheth the ill doer. Thou wilt ſtill cavill and ſay, thou haſt oft done thus, and are not yet ſtricken from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: I anſwer, the more is behinde; the Lord can ſmite with dumbe ſtrokes in a worſe manner. But doſt thou ſo abuſe his patience, and heape up wrath to thy ſelfe? But thou wilt ſay, I will abſtaine then, and ſo I hope to eſcape, for this charge concernes no other ſave receivers. I anſwer, thou excuſeſt a fault with a crime; thou canſt not thus eſcape, for God ſhall judge thee for both not comming, and not preparing. But thou pretendeſt, that its hard to trie thy ſelfe, and thou art ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, haſt no gifts: Well, yet be admoniſhed, Wiſdome is eaſie to him that will underſtand; thy ignorance comes not from ſeelineſſe, but wilfulneſſe. Thoſe whom thou canſt mocke as ſimple ones, can yet remember and repeate all theſe directions: And haſt thou loſt thy wiſedome in this buſineſſe? Oh! but thou ſaiſt, I am forgetfull Why? Save that, thou haſt no heart; for thou canſt remember any quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, or wrong, to revenge thy ſelfe. But thou wanteſt leaſure. Alas, the Trevant complaines of an ill penne, inke, and paper;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12335:132"/> But the fault is in his ſloth, elſe all were well. For why? Thou canſt finde a day in a weeke ſpare to hunt, to game, to drinke, to be in company, to ſit in the alchouſe: if thou carrie thy corne to market, thou doſt ſomewhat elſe beſides thy buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and ſo, if thy heart ſtood to this worke, thou ſhouldſt finde leaſure enough for it too.

And to end this uſe, breake off thy cavils, thinke not thy caſe deſperate; Say not, there is no hope for ſo ſaped a wretch as thou. Who can tell? Perhaps the Lord may bring hony out of a carrion, and even out of thy long contempt, fetch humiliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? I have knowne ſome touch'd more by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than by any terrour beſide: That the Lord hath ſo long ſpared them in patience: they have concluded, hee hath done it to breake their hearts. Perhaps the Lord will turne away his fierce anger, that thou periſh not: Howſoever it fare, bee doing, humble thy ſoule, and chuſe (if thou muſt periſh) to periſh in thy triall, rather than juſtly to runne hazard, and ruſh into aſſured miſerie, by not try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

I know indeede that where the Miniſter is moſt faithfull, many people are contemners, but their bloud be upon their owne heads: ſave thou thine owne ſoule, and let them not periſh by thy ſinne.

The Lord will accept a little endeavour, and judges us not according to that we want, but that wee have, if there bee faithfulneſſe. And let none thinke that this dutie is ſo urged, as if there were any merit in it from the worke wrought; No, thy ſearching it ſelfe ſtinkes, and thy very cloathes may defile thee, if thou looke at thy ſelfe. But looke at him that commands it, and hath promiſed a bleſſing to it: that is, <hi>So let him eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup:</hi> Let this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come encourage thee. And becauſe I have already laid downe ſome properties of triall for thy direction: I ſay no more, but ſeeke the Lord in prayer and deniall of thy ſelfe, to helpe thee to put one theſe cords and ragges, to come out of thy ill cuſtome. And to ſhut up all, let mee encourage all faithfull endeavourers to trie themſelves: I know there is cauſe; for many tender hearts foile themſelves ſore in this worke, and make the remedy worſe than the diſeaſe. They ſay, Theſe rules are ſo ſtrickt, that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practiſe them: and therefore cannot bee prepared: yea, they ſay, the more they ſearch themſelves, the more droſſe and ſcurffe they meete withall. To whom I anſwer, Firſt, let no difficulty of ſelfe-triall, in the point of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof diſmay any: let ſloth, contempt, and wilfulneſſe, be abſent, and the Lord will both admit of their honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to trie: and alſo (the weaker they are) ſo much the more welcome them to the Sacrament, which is more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belonging to the weake than the ſtrong.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>1</label> To which I anſwere, That it is no ſuch matter. The reaſon of the Triall is this, Firſt the Sacrament being a ſeale of the covenant of grace (as oft hath beene ſayd) and no converting meane of the graceleſſe unto grace (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) needes it muſt bee, that every one who would finde it as a ſeale to his ſoule of the encreaſe of Grace received, muſt firſt approve his eſtate in grace to bee ſound; except the Spirit of God ſhould bee made a ſervant of ſinne, and ſubject to the preſumption of hypocrites, willing to ſet his ſeale to a blanke. Things ſtanding in relation, import an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of ſuch as are out of that relation: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> If the Prince ſhould graciouſly proclaime that hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Charter of ſome Corporations in ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: No village, Townes or places that never had any ſuch priviledge from the Crowne, would bee ſo idle as repaire to the King, for they are excluded. If the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grant the King a ſubſidie from his ſubjects, no man that knowes himſelfe to bee no ſubſidie man would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare any ſuch money for the King; for the buſineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes him not. So is it here. The Lord calls his free-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons by ſpirituall baptiſme, to renue the Aſſurance of their pardon, peace, and adoption, at his ſupper; and promiſeth there to all ſuch, a further increaſe in the graces of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: ſhould then any be ſo madde as claime a part in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, who never have beene or baptized, called, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Spirit of grace at all? Now then how ſhall that be diſcerned? True it is, thoſe that are free borne, and true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, know it or may doe, as <hi>Paul</hi> quickely could tell <hi>Lyſias,</hi> he was a Romane. But who ſhall ſtoppe the mouthes of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and ſtrangers, ſuch as are of <hi>Aſhdod</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> when they come to plead themſelves Iſraelites? I meane when hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites come to the Sacrament, pleading themſelves to be Gods people: doubtles there muſt bee ſome Rules of Triall which will not deceive; they muſt be urged to proove their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12335:134"/> or elſe bee convinced to bee counterfeits.</p>

No, farre be it from any to thinke ſo. The Lord affords all his, To ſtand faſt in their liberties, and to be above the bondage not onely of Popiſh or Iewiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:<note place="margin">Gal. 5, 1.</note> but of unbeleefe eſpecially: and to walke according to that they have received: For peace ſhall bee to all that walke according to rule, even the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. Yea as its ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous for any ſuch to ſeeke new grounds to build upon: ſo is it ſinnefull to ſtagger about the old: becauſe the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God is with us, as the Covenant of <hi>Noe,</hi> as the Covenant of the Sunne and Moone:<note place="margin">Eſay, 54, 8.</note> yea everlaſting after theſe ſhall have an end. Farre other uſe are Gods people to make of this tryall at the Sacrament. Firſt, many know not all ſuch grounds as their faith reſts upon, although they beleeve unfeignedly: ignorance may hinder them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, although they have had them in a readineſſe, yet by Satans deluding them with other diverſions to worldly objects, or by forgetfulneſſe, or being dazeled by ſome ſecret love of evill, or by the errour of others, theſe things may be growne ſtrange to them, darke and to ſeeke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, although it be not ſo, yet may it bee a ſweete exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe for a beleever to bee well skill'd in his beſt Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it may joy him to have the things revived in his ſpirit which hee hath knowne before, and eſpecially at the Sacrament, when they may moſt encourage him. Men doe looke upon their evidences of lands for more ends, than feare of their Titles. And yet I will not deny, but that (as the caſe may ſtand) the triall of a mans eſtate at than Sacrament may and ought to bee anxious and ſollicitous: yea, and that ſo, that for the time he were better deſiſt than proceed: viz. when having ſnared himſelfe with ſome luſt which hee cannot eaſily bee rid of, hee queſtions his eſtate thereupon: and, till God have eaſed the hardneſſe and deſpaire of his ſpirit, through unbeleefe, perhaps hee can neither perceive nor yet relliſh his evidences as hee hath done. This
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12335:134"/> may be one caſe in which this tryall may bee uſed with ſome doubting and diſtemper: Howbeit neither is this ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to be ſure not the onely caſe. Therefore this objection is of no force.</p>
                     <p>To proceede then:<note place="margin">2 Sorts of tryall of eſtate. 1 Our firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> This tryall of our eſtate I would call to theſe two heads as breefly as I can. Firſt to a mans firſt calling home to God. Secondly, to ſome eſſentiall markes either accompanying or following the ſame.

Firſt the Lord calles a ſoule from an eſtate of woe and miſery through ſinne and curſe (common to it with all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> wherein ſhee lay plund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, deadly; from a covenant (I ſay) with ſinne, death and hell, wherein ſhee was wrapped.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1 By conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</note>One thing I muſt freely confeſſe, That there was never more cauſe than now in this forlorne Age full of formalitye and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling; (in which the Divell and the error of the wicked wold deceave the very elect, if poſſible) to preſſe upon the ſoule the neceſſity of faith with power. For, weake faith, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will beare out the ſtrong fiery darts of Sathan, which now in this ſubtill world, are on foot to try our effectualneſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. Men heare preachers ſay, Faith is as true in the leaſt ſparkle of it, as in the whole fire: and faith may as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in infirmity to hold the promiſe upon former experience, as in the greateſt ſtrength &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now (as I ſaid before) what uſe doth Satan make hereof in hyopcrites, ſave this? They need not bee ſo earneſt for faith, for the kind of it muſt ſave them, not the meaſure, and the weakeſt may bee ſaved as well as the ſtrongeſt. I could in this reſpect wiſh, that ſo oft as Gods Miniſters fall upon theſe Arguments, they tooke as good paynes to ſtave off the dogges, as to encourage the faithfull-weak ones. For when error hath once defiled a man in the root and truth of faith: then he growes preſumptuous to thinke that each wanzing motion and Pang after faith, is as good as that which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſelfedenial, and cleaving to the Promiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as faith of the true ſtamp, although it come ſhort of ſome feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſtirrings, and much more that overpowring of ſpirit that quaſhes unbeleefe; yet the Spirit of grace, putts forth it ſelfe in combat againſt their infidelity, ſetts it in the forefront
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12335:141"/> of Gods battery, (as <hi>

And in this warfare they looke for no diſcharge, till God have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them in ſome meaſure.</p>
                     <p>But to anſwere the objection, and ſo to conclude,<note place="margin">2 By Solution.</note> I affirme that not only the weak in faith, ſimply, but even the decayed in faith, yea the fallen into ſinne, if recover'd by faith, are not to be debarred from the Sacrament, till they become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of overpowring grace of the Spirit. It were exceeding abſurd for a Phyſition to ſay to one tormented with a burning ague, want of ſleepe; or like payne; That hee muſt forbeare Phyſick, and lie under his diſeaſe, untill he get more ſtrength, and recovery. What ſhall Phyſick availe him after, if hee die before? Or what needs it, if he be recovered? the Sacrament, I ſay ſtill, is rather the portion of the weake childe, than of the ſtrong man, ſo that a looſe, dallying heart bee abhorred; and to ſuch this ordinance ſerveth. And (to ſay truth) ſuch poore ſoules need not bee urged to more ſorrow than they feele: for what ſorrow is like theirs who mourne under unbeleefe? and yet even ſuch (as experience prooves) have found the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament effectuall, to ſend them away much ſettled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.

A pointe which is yet as a Riddle to many receavers: who although they looke at the Supper of the LORD as a ſervice of high devotion, fitt to hold men well occupied, and keep them from baſe earthly thoughts, yet alas! farre are they from once dreaming that it is ordeyned for a ſupply of all their wants. It needs a good Perſpective to ſhew a man the LORD IESVS Sacramentall, ready to fill the ſoule with all good things, much more to ſupply all our wants. Chriſt in the Supper is ſealed by the Father to give vs all that his Promiſe conteines: Now if that offer proviſion againſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12335:143"/> all defects, ignorance, unbeleefe, earthlineſſe: if that bee able to releeve the wants of the ſoule complayning, that ſhee is unable to beare a croſſe, to enjoy a bleſſing, to live well in marriage &amp;c. What leſſe can the Supper conteyne, ſave the ſealing up of that proviſion, and the unlocking of all GODS ſtorehouſe? The LORD in the Supper hath taken meaſure (as I have noted) of all the infirmities and wants of his Children: and although it bee not ſenſible to the eye of fleſh, ſave in a ſhadow of the Elements, (Bread to repaire ſtrength, and wine to reſtore the Spirits) yet ſo it is, There is all the LORD IESVS, (as one priuy to and ſenſible of all the wants of his members) to fill up every breach, to ſoder up every chinke and flaw of the ſoule, that can wayte for him. How ſhould the ſoule then put on the LORD IESVS his apparrell to cover her except her nakedneſſe in each part bee underſtood?

So much more is it in the New creature; it cannot feele a want of grace in it ſelfe (except it be not it ſelfe, but fallen into ſome ſpirituall lethargy) but it is ſenſible of it ſelfe, and cannot lin till it out-grow it, and ſupply it by

All cannot have great ſtockes: It is in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſtocke as in the temporall. A ſtocke of twenty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound for a poore man is as good as hundreds to a greater man. So here, Thoſe talents of knowledge and faith, nay though it be but one, (ſo it be not buried in a napkin) which a poore ſoule hath, are ſufficient for his eſtate. Perhaps ſuch a poore tradeſman, may by ſundry occaſions, want, heere twenty ſhillings, there forty, and ſo borrow and ſupply his wants, till his trade grow better, and his cuſtome increaſe. Yet for all this we count not ſuch an one a begger. But ſay thus, Alaſſe poore man he had never any great matter to begin with, but ye ſee he lives well, and brings up his charge, and keepes out of debt: and although he hath wants now and then, yet hee hath not ſpent upon the ſtocke, nor trades with other mens monies: Therefore its good to helpe ſuch an one in his wants, to keepe him from want. Thus is it with a poore Chriſtian: hee is not in want, yet hee hath wants, but his ſtocke abiding. <label type="milestone">

Onely they who have ſomewhat can thrive, becauſe they want ſomewhat to eike out their ſtocke with, and ſeeke more. Yee ſhall never heare a begger going from doore to doore, to complaine that hee wants a featherbed, or a bedſted, or a ſtocke of money, or an handſome houſe, or good cloathes, or cleane linnen: Alaſſe, his beggers coat, and cleane ſtraw in a Barne content him: his being in want, keepes him from the wants of a man that hath ſomewhat to take to. So heere, A poore Chriſtian ſtocked with ſomewhat, is ever wanting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; its in eye ſore to him to ſee others have and himſelfe want: here he mournes and complaines, Patience good Lord is wanting to my poore ſoule, I cannot bee humble and deny my ſelfe as others doe, nor pray, nor be thankfull.

Hee that hath, ſhall have more given him, till he have abundance: But from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that hee had. The Lord is a bountifull Father, not like to the fathers of our fleſh: If a child bee alway complayning to his father, what anſwer ſhall he have but a checke? Thou art alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning of wants, I put all into the bottomeleſſe purſe; But the Lord is a father of all abundance, and will give more than wee can aske or thinke; He upbraideth no man, and yet gives plentifully: Open thy empty hand and the Lord ſhall fill it: and eſpecially at the Sacrament.

Alas! perhaps many a man beeing at a Sermon, or under a ſudden Croſſe, or comming into ſome rare company, or ordinance; heares and ſees that which for the time ſmites him, and makes him lift up his hands and ſay, I ſee I am not as I ſhould bee (God helpe) but full of wants, too light, earthly, formall, &amp;c. But when once they are come into their old Elements, alas! they are as Saints <hi>Iames</hi> his foole, who turning his backe, forgets of what ſhape hee was, or what ſpots hee had.

This indignation at our wants, upon our continuall eying and obſerving them, would purge us of ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love and conceite of our owne worth and forwardneſſe, and provoke us to an earneſt ſeeking out for ſupply by any meanes whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>And that is the third and laſt rule: That we have theſe our wants ready ſummed up and at hand, when the Lord is making toward us with his Sacrament.<note place="margin">3. In a preſent view of them at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> If <hi>Naaman</hi> preſently upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, had his hand upon his owne ſore,<note place="margin">2 King. 5.20.</note> viz. his likelineſſe to correſpond with idolatry which yet he loathed: how ſhould we have our wants alway before us? How ſhould wee pray, <hi>Herein the Lord be mercyfull to me,</hi> (not when I go to <hi>Rimmon</hi>) but when I go to his Temple and Sacrament;<note place="margin">Iohn 1.17.</note> (where the Lord Ieſus his fulneſſe of grace for grace, and according to all his members wants, is preſent) that as I feele my wants of grace to gag me, my unfitneſſe for marriage, for family duties, my abuſing of liberties, &amp;c. So the Lord Ieſus would there meete mee with his ſpeciall ſupplies. Oh! if it were thus, how ſhould our hearts be on wing at the Sacrament, and how ſhould the fulneſſe of him who filleth all in all, both ſhame us for our unſutableneſſe to ſuch an head, raviſh us with his grace and proviſion, and transforme us from wanting to abounding, through faith in his premiſe! Herein LORD be mercifull to mee, in that I loath pride, but it will not away:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12335:148"/> Thou bidſt mee ſhine to others in Holy Conuerſation, but for lack of pureneſſe, I reflect my beames upon my ſelfe: Thou bidſt mee converſe in heaven, and loe, my baſe affections are ſo glued to my gaine, and my thoughts to the earth, that I ſeeme to bee as a bird whoſe wings are broken. What ſhall I doe then? Shall I ceaſe to ſhine, Shall I ceaſe to bee heavenly bycauſe of my wants! No LORD, but heerein bee gracious that I may ſhine with humility, and be above the world: Thou haſt promiſed that thou our God ſhal ſupply al our wants: and doe for us above al we can thinke or aske, Lord thy Sacrament is thy ſeale: Seales include al Promiſes or covenants: I ſee thee not with mine ey, but in thy promiſes: Lord ſeale them up to my weak faith: in this ſupply of my wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t above al other Lord ſhalt thou binde mee to thee for ever. Let others that want knowledge, finde a ſupply of it, but I want lowlineſſe, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, ruling of my toung and Paſſions: oh! let mee have my ſupply, each member her owne fulfilling; for every ſoule beſt knowes her owne ſorrow, and a ſtranger ſhal not enter into her joye. Thus come to the Sacrament in the trial of wants, and there wayt and give not the Lord over til he have anſwered thee, or given thee ſome handfel of ſupply, til more come, and ſo ſhal this Direction make thee bleſſe God for the fruit of this Sacrament. More I might have added: but I conſider I ſhal meet with a fuller ground of enlarging my ſelfe when I come to the 5. Sacramentall Grace of deſire: To which I refer the careful Reader: becauſe the grounds of this and that Chapter doe wel helpe to the underſtanding and practice of ech other. And thus much of the trial of our wants.</p>

                     <p>And there is good reaſon of it alſo:<note place="margin">Other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Supper is Chriſt in a myſtery: there are more myſteries in Chriſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall than verball: Not to ſpeake of all thoſe things which I have noted in the former treatiſe, conſider this: The Supper conteines the union of Chriſt Emanuel God made fleſh: The myſtery of Sacramentall union of Chriſt with the Elements: The myſtery of Chriſt Sacramentall united to a beleeving ſoule. The myſtery of faith in apprehending to it ſelfe thoſe particular benefits offred in the Sacrament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of not one is ſeene to the eye, but onely by a promiſe. Now tell mee, doe all myſteries of naturall, civill trades, arts, require ſuch skill ere wee can bee better for them, and can wee looke to receive this myſtery without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> knowledge is the key of all other things neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for preparation. How ſhall a man examine himſelfe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12335:150"/> in generall, try his eſtate by law or Goſpel, or ſearch out his wants, ſave by knowledge of them? Not to inſiſt in the graces that follow: whereof faith conſiſteth, partly of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall convincement of the underſtanding: and deſire of the Sacrament preſuppoſeth a knowledge of ſome thing ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſoule: (of unknowne objects there is no deſire.) So I might ſay of the reſt; knowledge therefore is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the Sacrament. When <hi>Paul</hi> prayes that the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> might encreaſe in faith: hee begins with the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part of the ſoule: Chap. 1. Verſe 17.<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.17.18.</note> 
                        <hi>That yee being enlightned</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in your mindes, may acknowledge him and the hope of his calling, &amp;c.</hi> So that true knowledge is the roote of all true ſavour of the grace or graces of God. If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the gift of God, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Iohn 4.10.</note> thou wouldſt have done ſo or ſo: So, if a man knew the Sacrament how would he love it? But not to know it includes a neceſſity of not beleeving, or well receiving it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The third.</note>Thirdly, the fearefull penalty threatned in the word againſt bad receivers, is by name annexed to the not diſcerning of the Lords body.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.29.</note> Now, though I grant there is more in that than meere ignorance, yet that is one mother root of not diſcerning. For what is that which cauſeth popiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ones, yea hypocrites to come to the Sacrament, as to common bread and wine in the ſhop or cellar, ſave that all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are alike in the darke, and ignorance puts no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene naturall things and ſpirituall? If knowledge then teach to diſcerne the body of the Lord, and to quit the ſoule of all this threat and vengeance, how needefull is it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The fourth.</note>Fourthly, the Lord hath (no doubt) ordeined, and the Church moſt wiſely made uſe of this ſecond Sacrament of groth, that by occaſion of it ſhee might take notice of the thriſt of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the doctrine of the foundation, and by name of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and ſo conſequently of ſuch things as they have bin taught in the miniſtry, Alas! The Preacher followes not (nor can) all ſuch to their houſe as have heard him catechize or preach, to demand an account of his labours, (as were to be deſired.) If then there were not ſome awe and bridle put upon men by the Church (which yet alas! few make uſe of among our Miniſters)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12335:150"/> how ſhould the Miniſter know the plight of his poore people from their baptiſme to their grave? Though I grant, private viſitation is needefull: but what one of an 100. looke after it of themſelves till their deathbed? Now the Sacrament is ſo holy an act of worſhip that few are ſo baſely vile as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that there ought to be ſome more than common ſcrutiny and ſearch what knowledge they and theirs have gotten.

So doe devout ones, they are ever in motion, and never the nearer. Devotion of this kinde is fitteſt for Papiſts, who are under a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and a worſhip of mans braine, having no footing in the word:<note place="margin">Ier. 4.12.

Sure it is, if the time which they ſpend there were ſpent in getting knowledge, as meane as they are, their trades would not keepe them from it. But what baſeneſſe will not men ſtoope to, yea,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12335:151"/> abaſe themſelves to hell in their cavills,<note place="margin">Eſay 2.</note> ſo they may live ſtill in their profaneneſſe! I doe not allow any who are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their trades under pretence of hearing, or getting knowledge; but I ſay, trades neede not hinder from a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance upon the meanes, if the heart bee good.

But the contempt of men to whom Chriſt is hidden,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3.</note> might juſtly both deprive them of meanes, and ſtreighten the ſpirit in the meanes, that ſo they might complaine for ſomewhat. But to end, one would thinke, that theſe men ſhould reaſon contrarily and ſay, If I bee ſo ſeely, and the Sacrament ſo darke, what an honour and prayſe were it for mee a ſimple man to have more skill and knowledge in it, than others above my ranke? Surely in other matters of hardneſſe men diſpute ſo: onely in theſe they are content to let all goe beyond them, yet God be thanked, There want not even among the ſeelieſt Chriſtians, many whom God hath made wiſer in his matters than their ancients and betters in worldly wiſedome:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.12.

But let them ſpeake, Is it their ignorance that makes them better? No ſurely. Well then, neyther is knowledge in the fault that the other are ſo bad: No man ſhuns money, becauſe the richeſt are ſo covetous; nor fine cloathes, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them is hidden many a rotten body: So neyther let men miſlike knowledg for the ſins of them that have it: No, its their hypocriſy, their profanenes which defiles their knowledge.

They reſt, in heere a ſnatch and there a catch at a good point, in their good affections, innocent lives and blameleſſe carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: But as for diſcerning of things, peiſons, doctrines that differ, holding that which they have ſpent many a weary ſtep to come by, grounding themſelves upon the word for their eſtate and actions, and ſeeing how they have their warrants not from a Preacher (whom they love and like) but from the ſtrength of truth which cannot lye; growing up in knowledge, that ſo their hearts might waxe better, and themſelves more ſetled in Chriſtianity: Oh theſe things are as the ſound of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters unto them, farre above them.

As for example, if I ſhould que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with many a Chriſtian, in what nature Chriſt ſubſiſts, or how a perſon and a nature differ, or how Chriſts humanity is not a perſon, but a nature: perhaps I ſhould gravell them, whereas yet they beleeve firmely the Lord Ieſus to be fleſh, and truely God, and both made one Chriſt for the working out their ſalvation. The like may bee ſayd of other points which to the skilfull are taken for granted, yet to them are not ſo cleare. As, how Chriſt ſhould ſatisfie, and yet not taſt of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12335:152"/> helliſh torments, in what ſpeciall office the act of ſatisfying ſtandeth. To what part of the Catechiſme each article of truth as the Sacrament belongs. So, I am perſwaded, many a poore ſoule conceives not of each myſtery in the Sacramentall union, although he beleeve Chriſt to be there preſent in his word and Spirit to a faithfull ſoule. Therefore of ſuch knowledge this I ſay, The more the better, but many who want it may yet be good receivers.

So againe, perhaps every one cannot diſtinguiſh betweene the habite of a New creature, and the operations of holineſſe iſſuing thence: yet its neceſſary that hee know all Gods people muſt be holy. Say againe, All cannot tell how many kinds of faith there are: By what ſteps faith is wrought: What is conteined in a promiſe: What Chriſt hath in ſpeciall obey'd in, or ſuffered: what the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall workes of the Law are, how many kindes of ſinne there bee, and by what meanes <hi>Adams</hi> is derived to us: yet neceſſary it is, that he be convinced of all theſe in their natures gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: and finde them wought in himſelfe particularly.

                        <note place="margin">The 2.</note>Secondly, if we goe not to worke by halfes, that is, to catch up knowledge in what kindes we pleaſe, ſcumming off the fat and ſweete of the eaſieſt duties, or that which will ſtand with our owne wils or knowledge of ſome Promiſes or priviledges. But as for knowledge of our ſelves, our natures, our ſinnes, we are backward to them: If we rejoyce that there is a word that croſſeth us in our belovedſt ſinnes, that ſmites us under

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Take it for granted, that the wiſe Reader will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which was before ſaid,<note place="margin">Entrance.</note> that faith is not required as all other graces are, that is, onely for the better receiving of the Sacrament. But that it is above all other the moſt eſſentiall grace, and the immediate inſtrument of receiving that which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament exhibits: By how much the more diligence ought to be uſed by a Chriſtian Communicant, that this grace be tried to be ſoundly wrought in him, and revived at the Sacrament. This caution being premiſed, I come to the matter it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>For the better conceiving whereof, what this triall of faith in the Sacrament imports, I thinke it meete, by ſome ſteps to ground this point in the Readers minde,<note place="margin">Grounds of this point na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> and to lay downe theſe three things: 1. That the Lord offers the good things which he beſtowes upon his faithfull ones, onely by and in the way of a promiſe, which faith laying hold upon in ſpeciall, takes the name from that promiſe; as Sacramentall faith is ſo called from a promiſe of a Sacrament. Secondly, that each particular promiſe depends upon a former maine promiſe; that is, the promiſes of Sanctification, upon the promiſe of Iuſtification, and the promiſes of more grace and growth upon the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of reconciliation, and ſpirituall or lively being in grace: ſo that he who would trie the latter, viz. a promiſe to grow by a Sacrament, muſt firſt trie his intereſt and part in the maine promiſe. Thirdly, that who ſo hath by ſound evidence prooved his right to the firſt; may and ought with hte more eaſe proove
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12335:158"/> his right to the latter, faith in the latter depending upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the former.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The 1. ground Heb. 4.13.</note> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Step. </seg>1</label> Touching the firſt of theſe three, viz. That God offers and conveighes all his goodneſſe by a promiſe alone (externally) conceive it by theſe few ſteps. Firſt, it being God our Father alſufficient with whom the ſoule is to trade for his graces <hi>(as</hi> Saint <hi>Iame</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Every good gift and giving commeth from the Father, who of his owne good will begat us)</hi> we muſt know, God is infinite, immortall, and incomprehenſible. Needes then muſt it be that this infinite good convey himſelfe to a finite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by ſuch a meane and way, as the poore weake carnall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can reach it. For elſe what proportion is there betweene one and the other? How ſhall fleſh comprehend a Spirit? No more than a little childs ſhort arme can reach a thing farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. Therefore the Lord conveyes himſelfe to the poore ſoule, by an ordinance: which is ſuch a thing as conſiſts of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and yet unexternall or ſenſible nature. An Ordinance is the ſubject to which God communicateth himſelfe and his goodneſſe, with a power of his Spirit to carry them to the ſoule: as by preaching of the Word to the eare, through the ſound of a mortall voyce: By prayer, conſiſting outwardly of ſentences &amp; order: By the Sacrament alſo, ſtanding of outward weake Elements: The Lord carries to the ſoule by theſe, moſt inward and ſpirituall things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Step. </seg>2</label> Secondly, though an Ordinance have Gods good things contained in it: yet ſtill there is a great gulfe ſet between us, our ſpirit and minde, and betweene the good of theſe Ordinances; for we are blinde, and they are myſticall and heavenly. Wee may ſit and heare, and receive the Word, or the Sacrament, and yet we may be held off as it were at ſtaves end from the good and life of an Ordinance. There muſt be a ſecond meane to bring us and them together. This meane muſt be the fleſh of the Lord Ieſus in an Ordinance. All Gods good things being firſt given to Chriſt our Head and Mediatour, that ſo by his fleſh they might be conveied to us familiarly: needes it muſt be, that except Chriſt be in an Ordinance, as our Prophet, Prieſt, and King, that ſo by him they might be united to us, firſt ſenſibly, after ſavingly: it can not be that any Ordinance can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12335:158"/> doe us good; wee ſhall ſtill bee ſtrangers to it, though our bodies and ſences be never ſo neere it. For example, Prayer is an Ordinance, by which God imparts himſelfe deepely to the ſoule: yet except the ſoule caſt anchor upward by faith upon the fleſh of our Advocate, giving ſtrength and life to it; Prayer is but a morall devotion, and a meere ſhaddow in reſpect of uniting thoſe good things to the ſoule. Likewiſe the Word of God preached, if it want the fleſh of Chriſt our Prophet and Head: it will carrie nothing, ſave by a bare ſound into our eares: The words he ſpeakes are life and ſpirit, and muſt be carried by the ſpirit of our fleſh into us,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6, 63.</note> or elſe not at all. And note this. The more of Chriſts fleſh an Ordinance containes, the more it imparts Gods good things to the ſoule. And ſo the Sacrament of the Supper, conſiſting of the very materials of Chriſt, fleſh and bloud, muſt needs be very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull meanes of grace to the ſoule: and muſt needes carrie the good things of Chriſt, born in point of ſatisfaction and of ſanctification, pardon, and holineſſe; into the ſoule in a more peculiar manner, as being the inſtruments of both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Step. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, as Chriſt in an ordinance is the way of Gods convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf: So Chriſt is conveied in an ordinance by a promiſe or els not at all. Take away Chriſt and an ordinance is nothing: and even ſo, take away a promiſe, and Chriſt in an ordinance is of no effect to thee: The ordinance is excellent becauſe Chriſt is there: Howbeit thou art never the better for it, becauſe thou wantſt a promiſe, by which Chriſt conveies it to thee. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinances as God grants thee, ſo many promiſes he makes to thee of bleſſing: one ordinance is not the better for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of another: Prayer cannot looke at the promiſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; nor hearing of a Sacrament, becauſe each of theſe are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall meanes of conveying Gods good things unto thee. But each ordinance muſt have a ſpeciall promiſe: Chriſt in it comes in and by the way and channel of a promiſe. The cauſe is plain, becauſe no ordinances can be ſavory, except mixed with faith, and faith there cannot be, where there is no promiſe for it to worke upon.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion then of this firſt ground,<note place="margin">Concluſ. of 1. ground.</note> is this, If God will give his graces to the ſoule, it muſt be by the meane of an
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12335:159"/> Ordinance, of Chriſt in an Ordinance, and of a promiſe. A promiſe is the immediate way by which Chriſt in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is made ours. As the promiſe is, ſo faith beares her name: faith in a promiſe of the Sacrament, is Sacrmentall faith: and he that would try whether hee gets by the Sacrament, muſt trie his Sacramentall faith. This for the firſt ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Vſe of this ground.</note>Ere I proceede, let this point teach us to mourne for the common ſort of Chriſtians, and Reveivers of the Sacrament, of whom I may ſay, as thoſe in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> ſaid to <hi>Paul</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: <hi>They never heard whether there were a Spirit or no.</hi> So, theſe worſhippers of God, and hangers upon Chriſt and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, yet cannot tell us, whether there be any promiſe or no, any faith in a promiſe or no. They will keep their Church, and come to the Ordinances, pray, and receive, but the way of faith in the promiſe they have not knowne. To whom I ſay, ſave for faſhion ſake: What differs a Popiſh corrupted or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance from a pure Ordinance of God (I ſay, in reſpect of good to thee) yea what d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffers thy abſence from thy preſence. in this regard? Oh tremble at this, all ye that profeſſe God, and yet know not a promiſe, nay, I ſay! profeſſe to beleeve and yet know not a promiſe. Was it ever heard that faith could ſubſiſt without a promiſe? Oh therefore I ſay to all ſuch, judge what caſe yee are in: ye are without God in the world, and are ſtill barren of all his good things, either of Reconciliation, or of Regeneration: your Baptiſme, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and receiving are emptie, and never doe him good: For you never got any thing by a Promiſe: A promiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrought upon you any life of God, or growth in that life: ye never ſaw neede of Gods good things, never emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied your ſelves of your ſelves by ſelfe-deniall; If yee had, theſe would have preſently brought yee to a promiſe to bee ſuſtained by, as the Woman of Samaria drew her neighbours to Chriſt. I conclude therefore, the faith which ſuch pretend is an Idoll; a faith hanging upon the bare ſtory of a God, a Creator, a Chriſt, a Redeemer, not in God; and ſuch a faith is a meere hangby and formall notion of a thing a farre off: its a faith of the Church, a faith of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, a faith not of adherence to a promiſe, but of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12335:159"/> meere heareſay of things, which thou never, either felteſt any neede of, or ſoughtſt any part in. And therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art whoſe faith is no other, know that thou liveſt a moſt wofull life, without any of Gods gracious influence, and when thou dieſt (except thou be changed) thou ſhalt die without comfort or hope. Therefore, to this thy heareſay of God and his good things, adde faith in a promiſe, and thou ſhalt enjoy God in an Ordinance, and by name in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſavingly, really, and comfortably. Oh! let all thy weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and miſpent former time, ſting thee for thy unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, and now in time looke about thee.</p>
                     <p>I come to the ſecond ground.<note place="margin">The ſecond ground of this point.</note> Every particular promiſe of good things from God, is planted in a generall and maine promiſe. So that he who would try him ſelfe whether this or that good thing be his or no (as the gift of patience, right uſe of the croſſe, growing by the Sacrament, &amp;c.) muſt firſt trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in the Covenant or no, which is the wel head of the reſt. For this one Covenant, to be our God reconciled, includes, yea, gives a being to all other promiſes, that God in this or in that, will be our All-ſufficiency. True it is, each poore ſoule ſees not this. The reaſon is, becauſe they judge of the chiefe promiſe, according to the limit of their preſent feeling; that is, becauſe in the agony of their loden ſpirits, they feele moſt need of Chriſt to eaſe their conſcience of guilt, and to ſettle peace, therefore they ſee it not to reach further than their preſent neede. Whereas, Chriſt being ſuch a gift as either is wholy denied, or wholly given, cannot bee divided;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 13:</note> but is by the ſoule (if ſhe knew it, and were not too narrow to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it) received as he is given, all at once. Onely the ſoule retailes him in particular, as ſhee meetes with her needes of him; and then by recourſing to the maine promiſe, finds her right to all the reſt. As the ſmaller boates tied to the great ſhip, follow their motion; ſo is it heere. At leaſure the ſoule comes to ſee her penny worths, which at the firſt appeared not: even as a purchaſe of worth, doth not all at once appeare to the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſence, but at leaſure, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of it come to hand. Now when the ſoule comes to behold them, then ſhe ſees all couched in a generall gift of Chriſt made to be her peace and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12335:160"/> pardon. Secondly, the reaſon of this is, becauſe God is the God of order. He firſt ſets the ſoule out of the danger of <hi>Adams</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of grace, becauſe the ſoule is not elſe capable of any good thing. Now in taking away this guilt he aſſumes the ſoule againe into union and fellowſhip with him in all the good things which ſhe enjoyed before. When the gulfe is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way which ſeparated the ſoule, then the way lieth open to the ſoule to recover all her priviledges in time paſt. Thirdly, this is true in reſpect of congruitie of providence: For having once granted a being to the creature of ſpirituall life, he doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in binde himſelfe to a ſupporting of that life; elſe hee ſhould plucke downe that which he hath built, and undoe his owne worke.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.94.</note> As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am thine, Lord, ſave me.</hi> I meane not that beleeving one promiſe ſhould ſave us a labour in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt: But become a good pledge of performing the reſt.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> As all the promiſes of God in Chriſt, are yea, and Amen: ſo, all ſpeciall ones are yea and Amen in the generall. <hi>He that hath given his Sonne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> 
                        <hi>how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Vſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground.</note>The uſe of which briefely is, to inſtruct and convince us of that horrible treaſon to Gods Alſufficient promiſe, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is guilty of, who will not cleave to God in his firſt and maine promiſe of mercy and redemption. Alas, what man is there who oft deſcries not to find God good to him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, there to fill him with good things, ſeale vp his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, purge out his corruption, and the like. But becauſe hee ſeekes not to know God in his Covenant, how ſhould his Seale doe him good? What is a Seale, ſave a relation to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bargaine? If thou never ſtrakeſt hand with God for his Chriſt thy righteouſneſſe, how cameſt thou in for his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſanctification, and redemption? They belong not unto thee: either thou muſt have all Chriſt to ſet thee out of feare, or thou haſt never a whit of his benefits. And to apply this to the preſent point, how ſhouldſt thou come to God by ſpeciall faith in the Sacrament, when thou wanteſt him in the chiefe faith of the firſt promiſe? Oh! then cutteſt off thy ſelfe, thou knoweſt not from what liberties, and mercies, when as thou art careleſſe to be made ſure of the maine. Thou ſhouldſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12335:160"/> thus. The time will come, when I ſhall crouch to God for ſtrength to beare the Croſſe, to be afflicted in all my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to die willingly, &amp;c. But then why doe not I the whileſt make ſure in the maine with the Lord, that he might finiſh his owne worke and ſave me, becauſe I am his? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if I dally with this, or goe upon falſe grounds, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelfe, the Lord will be guiltleſſe in not regarding mee, becauſe the time was when hee cried out to my ſoule, Beleeve, robbe mee not of my glory, diſtruſt mee not in my offer: But becauſe thou wert deafe to my cry,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.24.</note> ſo its juſt that I ſtoppe mine eares at thine; goe therefore and ſeeke releefe of thy idols of eaſe, ſelfe-love, and the world which thou preferredſt before mee. It is with thee as it was with Iſrael, <hi>Iudges,</hi> Chapter 1. verſe 21.<note place="margin">Iudg. 1.21.</note> The Lord had given them one promiſe for all, to drive out the Cannanites; now becauſe they beleeved not the maine, therefore here one Cananitiſh city, there another prevailed, and became goades and prickes to them. And ſo, hence it is, that neither promiſe of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or of other Ordinances doe prevaile to purge out their luſts, but they remaine as thornes unto them, becauſe they never tooke paines to joyne iſſue with God in the truth of his Covenant to pardon them, and make them his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thus much for the ſecond ground, teaching, that the triall of ones ſpeciall faith, reſts in the triall of the maine.</p>
                     <p>The third ground iſſues from this ſecond,<note place="margin">Ground 3.</note> viz. That the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of our firſt beleeving, may, and muſt make the other eaſie and familiar. Its our great ſinne if it bee otherwiſe, For why? The Lord gives us aſſurance of the one in the other; yea, teaches us to argue from one to another without wavering, ſo far as our weakeneſſe will permit. Excellent is that of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.10.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> 
                        <hi>If when we were enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by his death, how much more being friends, ſhall wee be ſaved by his life?</hi> Marke his manner of ſpeech, How much more? If God made that eaſie to us, which ſeem'd impoſſible, how much more eaſie is that which is under a direct promiſe? if God had caſt us quite off being enemies, we had the mends In out owne hands, and could not complaine: But having his

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1 Poſition. The meane conducing to faith.</note>Now for the firſt Poſition. The meane conducting unto faith, is, the diſtinct underſtanding of the Doctrine of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt, both in life and death. It was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Election, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.3. (not the cauſe) in which the Lord anſwered his owne Iuſtice fully, to the end that here might ſet open a doore of mercy to poore <hi>Adams</hi> loſt poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Now, that which was a meane ordained by the Lord, for the declaring of his righteouſneſſe in ſaving,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> muſt be the meane alſo to conduct the ſoule to faſten upon the offer of God. For why? As nothing ſave a ranſome could ſtop the courſe of Iuſtice, or cauſe him to be reconciled with a ſinner: ſo, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſtop the feare of conſcience guiltie of wrath, nor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12335:162"/> warrant her, that ſhe may be reconciled to God, ſave this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation. Till the ſoule come to know,<note place="margin">Eſay 27, 4.</note> that anger is not in God: ſhe cannot thinke ſhee may dare come neere him; ſeeing ſhee knowes him to be a conſuming fire. Therefore, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.21. <hi>Paul</hi> grounds a fearefull ſoule ſtrongly upon this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. Be reconciled to God (poore ſoule.) For why?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.22.</note> Hee hath made him to be ſinne that knew none (both by obaying and ſuffering) that wee might be the righteouſneſſe of God in him. So ſaith <hi>Elihu, Iob</hi> 33.24.<note place="margin">Iob 33, 24.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>The triall then of faith by this Rule is this.<note place="margin">Triall by this.</note> Canſt thou ſay truly that in the conflict of thy ſoule with Gods anger for thy ſinnes, (thy long lyen in, deepely died ſinnes, both of omiſſion, commiſſion, morrall, ſpirituall, offences and revolts) thou haſt beheld the meane of grace, in the alſufficient merit of Chriſt? Hath this ſtai'd thy heart, that God hath cut off his plea againſt thee, in giving his Sonne to ſatisfie? Canſt thou ſay,<note place="margin">Heb. 10, 20.</note> that thine high Prieſt hath brought thee to God, and cauſed thee to ſee his face with joy? Haſt thou ſent Satan to Chriſt, and told him, God cannot be ſatisfied, and yet angry ſtill?<note place="margin">Heb. 6.18.</note> Haſt thou found ſtrong conſolation (in the purſuit of Satan) from this, that thou beholdeſt this citie of Refuge, the ſatisfaction of Chriſt as a ſure Sanctuary to reſcue thee from the avenger of bloud?<note place="margin">Pſal. 100.7.</note> Haſt thou dranke of this brooke (or well-ſpring) and lifted up thine head in hope of being accepted? Deny not thy ſelfe; if it hath beene thus with thee, it is a good ſigne: I ſay, a good ſigne, if thou haſt any condition of faith, any feeling of thy burden, wrought in thee, and ſending thee to this meane. For why? By vertue of this price, the righteouſneſſe of wrath is turned into a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of mercy; ſo that it is a meete and equall thing with God (having thus received a ranſome) to forgive: yea in Chriſt, God himſelfe was reconciling the world: and now he doth declare his righteouſneſſe in juſtifying a ſinner through the faith of Ieſus: yea, thou maiſt ſay with <hi>David, Save me O Lord, according to thy righteouſns.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
                     <p>Briefely for the 2. The object of faith,<note place="margin">The ſecond object.</note> which is the promiſe, which containeth 2. things, either the good things offred in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12335:163"/> promiſe, or the hearty meaning and purpoſe of him that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly markes the promiſe. The good thing offred in the promiſe, (pardon, peace, a purged conſcience, life of grace ſupport in grace, the earneſt penny of the Spirit, and the like) ſerve to draw the affections (which carry the ſoule) unto God, and to daſh out of countenance all falſe objects of gaine, eaſe, pleaſure, luſts, to draw the ſoule to God in deſire eſteeme of mercy, and in hungring, mourning, and endeavouring after Chriſt. Secondly, the manner of offring theſe good things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free, full, faithfull, entire, and ſimple, (exceeding deſirous the ſoule ſhould embrace them,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. ut ſupr.</note> ſorry it ſhould reject them, urging it to beleeve) ſerves to put it out of queſtion, that the Lord meanes as hee ſpeakes: elſe needed he not to have prevented us at all. but ſeeing even when we were enemies, neither deſerving, nor deſiring any favour, yet the Lord out of the meere graciouſneſſe of his heart would needs beſtow it upon us;<note place="margin">Triall by this.</note> therefore he would have us conclude, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of his freedome, if wee come in to lay claime and plead this promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Try thy faith then by the promiſe, thus; firſt, whence came thoſe diſpoſitions of heart in thee, I meane thoſe teares of thine, thoſe deſires, prayers, faſtings, and diligent ſearching after grace? Came they from ſelfe-love, or from an heart of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bringing thy money and coſt to God to buy mercy? If ſo, thou haſt little to boaſt of: but if the good things of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe wrought them in thee, if thou can ſay, that faith, and the preparations to faith proceeded from the promiſe: The good things offered therein, drew thee to God, as with cords. If thou canſt ſay, that thy good affections could never purchaſe faith; rather that promiſe which bred faith, bred alſo thoſe affections in thy ſoule, becauſe thou ſaweſt God willing to ſave thee, and pardon thee, therefore thou mourneſt after him, prayeſt unto him,<note place="margin">Ionas 3.9.</note> and (as <hi>Nineve</hi>) couldſt not give him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: the riſing of the Sunne, cauſed this dawning of heart in thee, and theſe making towards grace, it is a good ſigne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, try thy ſelfe thus: If the freedome, fulneſſe, and ſtrength of the promiſer, have truly wrought upon thee, then thy baſe conceits of the Majeſty of God are vaniſh'd, I meane
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12335:163"/> thy enmity and hatefull ſpirit is gone. And whereas thou once couldſt not thinke a good thought of him, but all thy thoughts framed him rather to be angry, envious, cruell, unbeteaming; now thou ſtoppeſt, and (as one better ſetled) beginſt to ſay; oh my poore ſoule, who couldſt never get out of thy ſlavery and ſlightneſſe, thinke of the promiſe a little better? What wilt thou ſay if by all this offering, urging, expoſtulating, charging to be reconciled upon paine of hell, the Lord meanes thee well? Perhaps he may. If while he ſeekes to ſave thee, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vize how to get out from him: will it not be bitter at laſt? Thus weake hope breakes the ice, and ſets the ſoule forward. Then the Spirit of grace createth in thee both thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſuch ſtrange goodneſſe, bounty, long-ſuffering, free grace and compaſſion, that thy heart breakes into wondring at him, and ſaying, <hi>Who is a God like to our God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mica 7. ult. 1 Sam. 24, 19.</note> 
                        <hi>forgiving and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the ſinnes of his people?</hi> Who could finde his enemie at the vantage, and not deſtroy him? Therefore my ſoule is even carried into the ſtreame of his grace, and perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. I ſee the good will and meaning of his heart ſhining in his promiſe; and whereas it was wont to be a barren ſound and emptie noiſe for me to heare a promiſe: now I ſee it as a veſſell ſtanding full and running over, yea, a ſtreame to carry me in, with holy confidence, ſaying, If the ſtrength of Iſrael can lie, if free grace, if faithfulneſſe it ſelfe can ſhrinke backe and deny it ſelfe, I am content to periſh. Thirdly, trie it thus; If a promiſe have beene thy Object, then thou confeſſeſt that the power it ſelfe to beleeve is in a promiſe as well as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to beleeve. The promiſe is the inſtrument of the Spirit to perſwade: And as when the Lord made a promiſe to the Iewes that if they did come to the Temple to worſhip, hee would keepe their dwellings and goods ſafe the whil'ſt: Lo, this promiſe had in it ſuch a power as held off all Robbers and enemies from attempting any pillage: they durſt not, they could not; ſo much more in the promiſe to a loaden heart, there is alway the ſtrength of God to effect that which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth: and ſuch a ſoule neede not ſtand out ſtrangerlike and ſay, here is a ſweet promiſe, if I could beleeve: But here is a promiſe ſtrong and able to cauſe mee to beleeve it:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12335:164"/> If in any meaſure theſe trialls be in thee, they are all good ſignes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Triall 3. By the roote of it.</note>Thirdly, trie thy faith by the roote of it, which root is ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall. All other graces ſeeme to have ſome inherencie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own in the ſoule: onely faith is rooted in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of a mans ſelfe. This ſelfe is nothing elſe ſave the ſpirit of old <hi>Adam,</hi> reſiſting the Spirit of grace, and as we ſee in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenced cities ſome of their Bulwarkes are out-workes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, others are maine ſorts neere the walls, wherein their chiefe ſtrength conſiſteth: So here, ſelfe hath her out-workes, ſelfe-wealth, ſelfe-eaſe, credit and eſteeme, learning, parts, experience. Theſe are more eaſily caſt downe, becauſe Chriſt and they are of two ſeverall kindes. Others are forts of greater conſequence, in which the heart more truſts, as carnall reaſon, and the wiſedome of the fleſh, which <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> calls high thoughts and ſtrong imaginations of fleſh, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves up againſt the obedience of faith; ſo alſo Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties and performances, whether will-worſhips of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, or duties required, as Iewiſh righteouſneſſe by the Law: and all the devotions of carnall Proteſtants. To theſe I may adde the ſecret counterminings of the heart, mixing it ſelfe with the preparation to faith, and ſo deſtroying the worke of God, as ſelfe-mournings, deſires, and uſe of meanes. Now of all theſe, the Scripture tels us, That if any will beleeve, hee muſt denie himſelfe, and be content to be ſtript of thoſe, or elſe grace will not dwell in him, Truſt not in thy owne wiſedome, but truſt in the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5.<note place="margin">Prov. 3, 5.</note> So <hi>Paul, That I may be found, not having my owne righteouſneſſe of the Law,</hi>

I ſayd before, that each ordinance of God is a ſeverall channell to convey the Lords goodneſſe in Chriſt to the ſoule. Although there be ſundry ordinances, and ſundry manners of conveyance, yet one hinders not another, but each hath his ſpeciall grace under the cheefe, (which is the Preaching of the word) for the ſupply of ſeverall wants in the ſoule. The benefits of Chriſt are diſperſed diverſely in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but ſtill Chriſt is one in all.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Tryall by it.</note>Try thy ſelfe then thus by the firſt rule. Doſt thou revive thy faith by turning the eye of thy minde carefully upon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Sacrament, as the hand of God to ſettle the gift of Chriſt thy food and refreſhing upon thee? Doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this ordinance! (ſo oft as it is offered) as a renued gift of God to thy ſoule? as a marke of the wiſedome of God, plying thee with the Supper, as hee knowes thy dayly ſpirituall ebbings and decayes require? And doth the heareſay of each ſacrament turne the ſpirit of thy mind towards it as a ſolemne object, which may not be wanted? Doth it poſſeſſe thy thoughts and memory more than common objects and paſſages of this life: Doe thy thoughts ſo minde it, heede it, doth thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo reteine it, as that it ſurvives other occaſionall matters, thy ſelfe longing while they be over, tha: this may poſſeſſe thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? and doth thy preparation unto it cauſe all other things to lye by?

                     <p>Secondly, proceed to thy Affections. I noted in the former
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12335:167"/> Treatiſe in the chapter of the Supper, that the good things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Supper are manifold. Looke backe and reade them.

And is it with thee as with a crazie diſeaſed man, comming into a Phyſitians cloſet, and there is ſhewed a boxe wherein his medicine lyes, which being applyed will heale him?

Hee offers Chriſt thy food and reſtorative with as free, beteaming, honeſt and full an heart of love, as ever he did the other. There is no oddes: except for the better: for heere in this ordinance (above all other) the Lord ſeales up his gift to the ſoule: that is, conveies it with the beſt ſtrength he can.</p>
                     <p>Try thy ſelfe then by this rule.<note place="margin">Tryall by it.</note> Doſt thou revive and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the blunt edge of thy weake faith by this conſideration?

Is the promiſe of thy ſoule ſuch a ſecuritie as a ſpecialty is from an able debtor, for the paying of a great debt? So that doe thou but ſue the bond, and the law will reſtore thy debt: Is it ſo here? Thy name is not written in the Scripture, yet the promiſe aſſiſted by the Spirit of Chriſt, layes the grace of the Sacrament as it were in thy lap (as <hi>Baez</hi> did the barley into the lappe of <hi>Ruth:</hi>) ſo that the Lord ſpeakes by it in thy eare thus,<note place="margin">Ruth 3, 15.</note> This fleſh is meate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and this blood is drinke indeed for thee: Take it, drinke it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 5.</note> It is a ſweete ſigne.

Firſt, let him remember that which was before ſayd, That in preſſing the tryall of repentance, I doe not meane that repentance concurrs to the act of receiving ſo properly as faith: But in a ſecond reſpect, as affording a ſweet witneſſe to the truth of faith already ſhaped in the ſoule: as alſo to honour the pureneſſe of the ordinance with ſutable pureneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and courſe. The ſecond thing I would have noted is:<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> That although in this tryall of repentance, it is to be ſuppoſed that each receiver of the ſeale, muſt firſt bee in covenant, that is, have his heart renewed: and in that reſpect that whole la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might be ſpared, how the ſubſtance of repentance may be tryed: yet, conſidering that it is not alway with receivers as it ought to be, but man ſtill will come without it. Therefore as I have done already in the point of faith, to ſhew the true forme and being of it, ere I came to handle the renewing of it at the Supper: So heere I will doe for the grace of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The rather leaſt any ſhould alledge his ignorance what it is, or wherein it ſtandeth: yet I will be ſhort, becauſe I have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12335:171"/> elſewhere handled it largely, viz. in the third part of my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, in the two firſt Articles. The third thing I note is,<note place="margin">The third.</note> That our ſpeciall and mayne enquiry ſhall be (in this tryall) about daily exerciſe and renewed practiſe of repentance at the Sacrament, and not onely as repentance is taken for ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent affection occaſioned: but as it is taken for that walking with God which conſiſts in the duties of mortifyed and quickned obedience to God and men: and that eyther in an ordinary courſe of innocency, or in the caſe of ſome ſpeciall revolt.</p>
                     <p>Before I handle the tryall of eyther the ſubſtance or the practiſe hereof,<note place="margin">Grounds of the point, firſt, Scripture.</note> I will ground the neceſſity of this tryall both in Scripture and reaſons. For the former whereof: Firſt, the Analogy of the old Paſſeover will proove it: wherein ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry charges were given which typifie repentance, and that in each part of it. As wee know the ſorrow and yrking of heart, and mourning bitterly for ſinne committed, was urged under the ceremony of ſowre hearbes:<note place="margin">Exod. 12.8.</note> not onely to ſhew what it coſt the Lord Ieſus ere he could ſatisfy: But to ſhew what they are who come to this Sacrament, even ſuch as peirced him by their ſinnes,<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> and therefore ought to come in bitterneſſe to the ſignes of his body and blood, and eate this ſweete meate with ſowre ſawce. So alſo the Lord required a ſeparation from the filthineſſe of the heathen, when they came to eate the Paſcall Lambe, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.21:<note place="margin">Ezra 6.21.</note> yea from all legall pollution, <hi>Numb</hi> 9.6.<note place="margin">Num. 9.6.</note> which as it concerned the Iewes alway in any offering or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo eſpecially at the Paſſeover. And the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> urgeth one other ſolemne ceremony of caſting out leaven. He that kept in his houſe any leaven at that time, more or leſſe, was to be cut off. Now leaſt wee ſhould thinke this to have loſt his force under the Goſpel, he ſaith, Purge out therefore all ſowre leaven (meaning their Communion with that ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous man, which ſowred their holy aſſemblyes) that yee may be a cleane lumpe, even as yee are unleavened. And why? For Chriſt is our Paſſeover ſacrificed for us: therefore let us eate him with ſincerity and repentance.

Concerning which worke of ſearch, becauſe I ſpake of it in generall in the firſt Chapter of this Treatiſe, I remit the Reader to that place.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Our friends perhaps ſee us better than we our ſelves, ſpy out our ſecret haunts, looſe liberties, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our zeale, and falling to our pleaſures, loving them and ſuch baſe companions as become us not, for our pleaſures ſake, more than Gods ſecret company, or his ſervants. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> So alſo our enemies ſometimes might tell us our ſecret corruptions: As hee once who fought with his enemy, ſearcht out that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume

                        <note place="margin">Our Soule part.</note>The next is the ſoule part, or the affecting. And heere in the firſt place is required a broken mourning heart for ſinne being thus ſearched out,<note place="margin">1. Brokennes</note> and that with uprightneſſe and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as <hi>Zachary</hi> deſcribeth it:<note place="margin">Zach. 12, 10.11.</note> 
                        <hi>They ſhall ſee him whom they have peirced, and mourne as one mourneth for his ſonne and heire:</hi> yea, they ſhall be in bitternes (note the phraſe) that is, godly ſorrow ſhall ſoke and ſape them, they ſhall be in the power of it, ſo that it ſhall over-rule them, they ſhall not eaſily ſhake it off; yea it ſhall be exceeding ſorrow, as that of <hi>Hadrimmon</hi> for the ſadde loſſe of <hi>Ioſia:</hi> and further it ſhall be fervent and ſincere, both ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the ſecrecy of it, husband apart, wife apart, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apart; as we ſay, He mournes truly that mournes without witneſſe. Such a ſorrow, ſuch teares, hearty and unfaigned, not in a mood, comming from a full heart, impotent and powring it ſelfe out before God plentifully, becauſe it hath greeved the Spirit of ſo good a God, ſo patient and longſuffering; I ſay ſuch a one is the true badge of repentance: which iſſues from faith. Wherein eyther teares are abundant, as at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi> or <hi>Mizpeh</hi> when the people drew buckets before the Lord:<note place="margin">Iudge 2.4.</note> or elſe in the want thereof, the heart ſheds teares of blood,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7, 6.</note> and the ſoule ſighes under a burden which ſhee cannot
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12335:175"/> well utter. This ſorrow uſually beares the name of repentance as being a maine companion inſeparable from it: and that true eating of ſowre hearbes required of him that ate the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: which hearbes grow no where, ſave in the garden of grace. Onely the love of that God whom the ſoule hath diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored even in the middeſt of mercy, and when ſhe peirced the Lord of life, then was that Lord willingly peirced to death by her, that ſhee might live, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. I ſay, this love onely can melt a heart of ſtone, and breake it in peeces, ſo that it cannot but repent, whereas before by the hardneſſe of heart,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> deſpiſing the patience of God, it could not repent. True ſearch of heart will worke true brokenneſſe, and cauſe the belly to tremble,<note place="margin">Habac. 3.16.</note> and rottenneſſe to enter into the bones, that it may finde peace in the day of trouble. Yea as the Lord turned the captivity of <hi>Iob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob 42.10.</note> when he prayed for his friends: So, in this through mourning of heart, tne Lord turnes the captivity of the ſoule and converts it to himſelfe. No terrours of conſcience can ſoften an hard heart; but rather they will harden it and bind it up to greater hardneſſe: As we ſee, an hammer may breake a bell to gobbets fit to be melted: but the fire onely can melt them, that ſo they may be moulded a new. So the love of God can onely effect this mourning after God, and broken heart, a moſt welcome ſacrifice to God: till which the ſoule cannot beteame the Lord herſelfe to be offered up unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.<note place="margin">Rom. 12, 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the heart thus broken breakes out into confeſſion;<note place="margin">2. Confeſſion.</note> and (as <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith) takes words unto herſelfe to expreſſe her ſorrow:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2.</note> for confeſſion is the true vent of godly ſorrow. This confeſſion is an uttering and powring of the heart out to God, when once ſorrow hath filled it to the brimme: and therefore in all thoſe texts almoſt where we have examples of ſorrow, confeſſion followes immediatly. Confeſſion (without this open, full, and affected heart) is as ſapleſſe and barren a thing and as unſavory a formality as can bee: Onely this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart will breake out into open and ingenuous confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which elſe keepes the impoſtume within her ſelfe, and hides it. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſweetely <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.5, 6.</note> ſaith, While I hid my ſinne, and nouriſht an hard heart, my bones were conſumed, and the fire burnt within mee: But when my heart thawed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12335:176"/> then I acknowledged my ſinne, that is, powred out my ſoule in confeſſion, and thou forgaveſt me the iniquity of my ſinne. This confeſſion is ſampled by the matter which is ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out and according to the ſorrow which the heart concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: and by both becomes a moſt humble, plaine, tender and hearty expreſſing of ſinne to the Lord, not onely in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but the circumſtances of aggravation. Its no mincer or leſner of it, but to the uttermoſt enlarges it againſt her ſelfe: according to eyther the greatneſſe, the extenſion and effects, the hainouſneſſe of it by the perſon committing it, the perſon againſt whom, the heart wherewith, the time when, place where, and all to make up an ingenuous confeſſion againſt it ſelfe. Oh! that one under ſuch meanes of mercy, even in coole blood, with the heart of a Traytor ſhould with ſo high an hand, with ſuch ſpirituall wickedneſſe offend the Lord (ſay it be by uncleaneneſſe, by living in a courſe of unprofitable hearing, hypocriſy, formality, vaine glory, pride, earthlineſſe, eſpecially unbeleefe, or as the caſe requires) yea that I ſhould ſinne againſt ſuch mercies and longſuffering of God leading me to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that to the horrible ſcandall of Religion, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of many in the like ſinnes! Oh woefull wretch, how ſhall I looke thee in the face! Thus confeſſion turnes up the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the heart, with ſhame and deteſtation, yea treading it ſelfe under Gods feete as unworthy to breathe in his ayre, or looke up to heaven: and makes it ſelfe vile and odious, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it ſelfe in her filthineſſe, with the pure eyes of God. See the confeſſions of the holy men in Scripture,<note place="margin">Dan 9.8. Ezra 10.1. Ezra 9.6. Pſal. 51.3.

                     <p>Thirdly, the ſoule having thus arraigned and indited her ſelfe before God, doth receive ſentence againſt her ſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing her ſelfe by her guilt,<note place="margin">Thirdly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> to lye juſtly under the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God for her ſinne: and doth juſtify God in all his ſayings, that hee may be righteous (whatſoever become of her;) Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12335:176"/> ſay, is the third ſtep: So to condemne her ſelfe as to applaud and juſtifie Gods ſentence: If hee ſay, ſhee is a Traytor, ſhee grants it; if hee ſay ſhe is cut off, and accurſed, ſhee confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it righteous: in all the Lords accuſings and judgings ſhee prevents him and judges her ſelfe, ſaying, True Lord, thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are juſt: If thou ſhould'ſt make all my dayes miſerable, it were but juſt, if all at once wrath ſhould ſeaze upon body, name, minde, conſcience, goods, wife and children, all were juſt, yea whatſoever is not hell, is mercy: hell it ſelfe being but juſt: and under this confuzion and heape of guilt and wrath ſhee lies, as one held downe with it; as one that lies under the ruine of ſome peece of building, fallen upon and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of his body. As wee ſee oddes betweene a face made white with colours, and appalled with a diſeaſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a vizard and a countenance conſumed and worne with lying bedred: which (though no man ſpeakes) utters it owne weakeneſſe. And this ſpirituall ſubjection of a penitent heart lying under her ſinne and ſhame, the holy Ghoſt much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes true repentance by: ſaying of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ier. 31.18.</note> I was as an heifer that knew no yoake, but after I was corrected I tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yea I ſmote upon my thigh, yea I was aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded becauſe I bare the reproach of my youth.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12335:177"/> doth hath ſinne in others, ſo eſpecially in her ſelfe, becauſe it knowes it ſelfe beſt: which zeale and anger againſt ſinne doth not onely ſtand in a meare pang of paſſion and diſtaſte, but even in a revenge of it ſelfe upon both it ſelfe and ſinne and all inſtruments thereof, in token of utter deteſtation. And why? becauſe it meanes no more to meddle with it; for if it did, it could not attaine to this degree. Firſt it conceaves a true en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt the ſin ſimply as ſinne, and oppoſite to the Image of God, be it greater or ſmaller, and the deeplyer, as it diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God moſt deepely. This is a worke of the Spirit put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a contrary Principle into a man, to hate that which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and love that which he hated: a thing which to fleſh, is impoſſible, for no man ever hated his owne fleſh.

When therefore true enmity is ſet betweene ſinne and the ſoule, that it can ſay, Lord I hate it, yea as my rankeſt enemy, its a worke of the Spirit: for before it counted him her enemy, who ſought to ſow the leaſt diſſention betweene ſin and her ſelfe. Then ſecondly, ſhee hath indignation againſt her ſelfe for ſinne: We know how our nature is given to miſcall our enemy; So doth a repenter miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call himſelfe.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11.</note> Thus the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſayd to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for that bolſtering up the inceſtuous perſon in his ſinne: and <hi>David</hi> called himſelfe (not in a pang but cordialy) a wretch,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.22.</note> a foole,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> a beaſt for his diſtruſt of the promiſe. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, O miſerable man!

                           </gap>.</note> How odious were it then for thee to returne to that ſinne, which the Lord hath cauſed to ſtinke in thy noſthrils?

So heere, renouncing of evill ſtands at the elboe of repentance, and when the old remnants of luſt ſuggeſt to the ſoule how ſweete it is, to keepe under hand ſome ſweete partnerſhip with ſinne, as uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, againe ſhe prompts it thus, How ſhall thoſe that are dead to ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 2. 2 Kings 9.32.</note> live any more therein?

                     <p>The latter part of the practiſe, is, returning to the Lord.<note place="margin">Or returning to God.</note> For repenting is no ſtaggering betweene two: its no darke carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, rather ſtanding in the abſence of ſome vices, than the practiſe of vertues. But, an apparent turning from the one that it might returne to the other: not to one or two duties, but to the Lord; univerſally, entirely, equally and faithfully, uprightly, and conſtantly, according to the meaſure of mercy received, And, by this phraſe the holy Ghoſt uſually urgeth repentance. For why? returning to God is ſuch a clozing with God in the promiſe of reconciliation and mercy: as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes to a cleaving cloſe to him in all his revealed will and wayes with comelineſſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 35.</note> without ſeparation; drawing dayly ſtrength from the love of God taſted and renued, to hold the ſoule to God with fuller purpoſe of heart, without revoltings, As the loadſtone pulles the iron to it ſelfe by a ſecret inſtinct, and ſo holds it cloſe; ſo doth the love of God attract the ſoule to God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.22.</note> and faſten it to him with delight, counting his yoake

It ſides with God, ſtands for God, the deſires of her ſoule are to him, his wayes and ends;<note place="margin">Eſay 26, 12.</note> yea the remembrance of his name. It ſeekes God, balkes no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or information of his will, wherein he will bee worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, even in all commands and ordinances,<note place="margin">Luke 1, 6.</note> both in the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſervice of the two firſt, as in the mediate of the third. Renuing covenant duely with him, where any breach hath beene, and looking more narrowly to her pathes, by occaſion of ſlippes. Not fleeting off the fat and ſweete, leaving the reſt: But taking Gods worke as it lyes, the hardeſt duties of ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniall and bearing the croſſe; aſwell as the eaſieſt; diligent in all thoſe meanes uſing, which ſerve either to purge out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or to nouriſh goodneſſe; obſerving and ſavoring all occaſions offered, to draw neerer to God in the fellowſhip of his graces, and in the increaſe of holineſſe. And to this courſe ſhe endeavours (as infirmitie will admit) to bend the ayme and ſtreame of her ſpirit, her thoughts and affections, without wearines walking with God, till he come unto her, watching to it, girding to it,<note place="margin">Luke 12, 35.</note> and ſtanding with her loynes girt and lampe burning, that at the comming of the Lord ſhee may bee found faithfull and well occupied. And thus much for a view of a chriſtian ordinary practiſe of repentance, ſo farre as I thinke meete for this place; leaſt any pretending willingneſſe to try themſelves, ſhould alledge they know not how.</p>

                        <note place="margin">And that. 1. Branch.</note>Know then, that for ſubſtance this repentance is no other, than the former: onely it differs in circumſtance. And for the better conceiving of it, obſerve theſe particular acts of it. Firſt, as the Lord ſuſteynes his people ſo, even by that ſeede of his in them, that they ſhall not totally ſhake out the Spirit, nor yet poure out themſelves ſo farre into ſinne as to ſinne with a full bent and ſtreame of ſoule, but with a checke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll of grace: ſo, when conſcience is awaked by any word or worke of God upon them, they are kept from extremitie of uttter depaire. Corruption through the malice of Satan, is alwayes ready to ſuggeſt utter deſerting of God, and that they are caſt out of his ſight. As we ſee in thoſe pangs of the beſt of Gods children in Scripture,<note place="margin">Eſay 38, 11. Pſal. 51.11. Ionah 2, 4. Lam. 3, 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Hezekia, David, Ionah</hi> and others, yea in the Church of God, forſaken for a time in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: all which were by temptation, brought to the graves brinke, and to thinke themſelves cut off from the land of the living:<note place="margin">Ier. 2, 25.</note> and to ſay, No, no. There is no hope. Here then the firſt worke of returning to God, is, To ſtay and ſtoppe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this headlong ruine; and by ſome glimpſe of God a farre off to bee kept from utter daſhing in peeces. Thus wee ſee in all thoſe examples (if wee looke into the texts) that the Lord wrought a ſtoppe of deſpaire: <hi>Iona</hi> in the Whales belly,<note place="margin">Iona 2, 5.</note> and in his horrors, yet ſtayes up himſelfe by an hope: Yet (ſaith hee) I will looke backe to thine holy Temple:<note place="margin">Lam. 3, 19.</note> and the Church in the Lamentations, conſidered and felt the gall and the wormewood, (that is, that God ſmote her not to caſt her off, but to draw her to repent) and ſo ſhee had hope. It cannot bee thus with the reprobate: who as they fall totally, ſo they want an eye to ſee God in their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but apprehend as diſmall and finall deſertion of God as <hi>Saul,</hi>

                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Branch.</note> the Lord addes a more cleere ſight of himſelfe to his fallen ſervants; and cauſes them more fully to call to mind his mercies of old, and thereby to bee more ſenſibly upholden. This is cauſed by a reviving of his ſeede in them, which cannot dye: So <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 119, 52.</note> even in his agonies when (to his feeling) the Lord had forgotten him: yet remembring times paſt, was comforted. [An hypocrite I knew will catch at theſe things to bane himſelfe, but children muſt not be ſtarved therefore.] They ſeriouſly weigh this, That neither their goodneſſe did firſt worke their pardon, nor yet that ſinne (truely repented of) can cut off their eſtate in grace: for why? The gifts of God are without repentance: and his Covenant is eternall.<note place="margin">Eſay 54.8, 9.

By which meanes ſhe ſees that even the ſinnes of deepe hardneſſe of heart yeelding to temptation and the violence of luſt, ſecure lying ſtill for a time in ſinne; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes, as falling to embrace the world, cleaving to baſe fellowſhip in evill, are yet curable revolts with God, and there is balme in <hi>Gilead</hi> for them, to heale them: not to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the ſoule to tempt God further, but in the ſence of bottomleſſe mercy to returne home for ever, as <hi>Oneſimus</hi> by occaſion of his running away, became better to <hi>Philemon,</hi>

                     <p>The third ſteppe is,<note place="margin">The 3. Branch.</note> that grace in the children of God fallen doth cleere up the underſtanding from that confuzion which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12335:180"/> ſinne elſe would cauſe in them, and deterre them from God and from any heart to returne. Thus it is with the hypocrite: his minde doth ſo preſent the multitude of ſinne, in ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a manner, that it confounds the ſpirit, and cauſes him to thinke,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 4.13.</note> that his ſinne is above pardon. The ſlavery of his defiled minde is ſo great when he weighes the woefull courſe which hee hath runne,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19. Rom, 2, 3, 4.</note> adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt, and heaping up wrath againſt the day of wrath, that hee is as one who hath run out above his ability to pay, and therefore his booke of accounts is yrkeſome to caſt over: it is death to him to thinke of it. Thus it was with <hi>Cain:</hi> each hundred of yeeres that hee lived, the debt of his murther was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by other ſinnes and the penalties thereof, that at laſt it became inextricable. But repentance in the true children of God cauſes the view of ſinne and the chaine thereof to bee preſented with ſome hope of forgiveneſſe: becauſe although perhaps the conſcience is amazed, yet its not privie to that trechery which the wicked were carried by in ſinning.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51, 4. Mark. 14, 72.</note> And therefore their ſinne is ſayd to bee ever before them: they are ſayd to come to themſelves; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is ſayd to weigh his ſinne, ere hee went out; which argues that the weight of it oppreſſed him not. Thi reviving of the mind from the horrour and oppreſſion of it, is a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the midſt of ſuch miſery. <hi>Iona</hi> was infolded as in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of Sea,<note place="margin">Ionah 2, 6.</note> Whale, and conſcience; yet in this gulfe hee was not ſwallowed up, but conceaved in his mind a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe for God to bring order out of his confuzion. So that the firſt occaſions of revolt, the circumſtances attending, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees following, and the danger incurred: rather ſerve to magnifie mercy in keeping the ſoule from utter Apoſtacy from the living God, than to beate off the ſoule from hope.</p>

                        <note place="margin">The 4.

                     <p>The fifth is,<note place="margin">The 5.

The Sacrament is preſent, and calls each moneth or quarter upon thee; Repent, repent, and come; elſe come not: and thy repentance is to come, thou haſt none for the preſent; what? Lookes thou to be welcome in hope of after repenting? What if thou be taken away (as thouſands have beene, who have hoped for more) before another Sacrament come? Oh foole!

If God will give each penitent ſoule forgiveneſſe, will he therefore give each ſinnefull dallier, repentance? How wilt thou anſwer him for thy not renewing thy Covenant with him at each Sacrament?

                        <note place="margin">Conſolation.</note>Laſtly, this Doctrine affords us uſe of Conſolation, which belongs to all the poore ſervants of God, that cannot (as they would) comfort thmſelves in their triall of repentance. Oh! ſay they, our life is a continuall revolting from God, but rare repenting: If (ſay they) repentance be ſuch a thing as ſtands in the renewing of the ſoule, the ordinary practiſe of the life, and recovery out of our falls, wee cannot ſay much for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Well, but I demande of thee, Are theſe wrought in thee, for the kinde? Is there a ſound heart in all, though much weakeneſſe? Then thy weakeneſſe ſhall not ſunder thee and the Lord at the Sacrament. But why then (will you ſay) doe you preſſe repentance ſo ſtrictly? I anſwer, Not to urge repentance in perfection here, for that is for heaven; but to provoke all beleevers to the greateſt meaſure that they can here attaine unto. And let ſuch be comforted, that the Sacrament belongs to them for their further encreaſe. It is as if a poore Lazer ſhould have ſaid, Hee was not worthy to ſtep into the poole, when the Angell had roared the water. Oh!
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12335:186"/> But if the poole ſerved to heale ſuch an one, it had beene a wrong to have deprived himſelfe of the poole, by that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which rather ſerved to encourage him. God ſees not the unavoidable defects of his owne, nor imputes them: he lookes at that which is good and his owne in them, and paſſes by the bad which is theirs. In this caſe thy faith muſt fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4,</note> when thine owne is too weake: That muſt be thy chiefe Robe to cover thee, though thine under-garment be worne and thinne. Oh! but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mourne (they ſay) their hearts are dead and ſenſeleſſe; no ſooner doe they reſolve upon a forſaking of ſinne, but it ſalutes them againe preſently. They keepe no Covenant almoſt which they renew at the Sacrament. Well, I praiſe you not for this: yet I hope you mourne, that you are ſo mourneleſſe, and you are not dead ſo farre forth as you feele it. Strengthen the feeble hands,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.12,</note> and make ſtraight that which is crooked: Revive the edge, and furbiſh the blade of your repentance. But to refuſe the meanes of your growth and encreaſe, becauſe you are weake, were to conclude; That becauſe you are but poore, therefore you muſt ſtarve your ſelves. Nay rather, you have the more neede of ſtrength; Goe to the Sacrament that your complaints may be fewer, abſtaine not, becauſe you feele cauſe of complaining. For ſo you may adde oyle to the flame, and the divell will rejoyce, but to be ſure your ſelves ſhall be the greateſt lozers. And touching the triall of repentance ſo much.</p>

A moſt maine grace for the Sacrament, and of ſpeciall familiarity with it.<note place="margin">Entry. Three things.</note> And for the better conceiving hereof, I purpoſe (God willing) to handle theſe three things. Firſt, I will ſhew what this love is: ſecondly, I will prove the truth of the Point by Scripture and Reaſons; thirdly, I will make uſe of the Doctrine, and therein I will propound the trials of this grace. Premiſing ſtill this caution, that as needefull a grace as this is, yet I make it not of that eſſentiall nature for the very act of receiving, as faith, though otherwiſe moſt neceſſary for the Supper, becauſe its that grace which improves and beautifies the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, and much more the Communion (for ſo we call it) of the Supper.</p>

                        <note place="margin">1 What it is.</note>For the 1. of theſe three: Sacramentall love (differing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe from the grace of love, than as reviving of it differs from the thing it ſelfe) is a grace of the Spirit in the ſoule of man, and the daughter of faith, renewed by occaſion of the Sacrament in all true receivers; whereby they are ſo united unto all that are their fellow members, that they enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all occaſions of their good, for the ends of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.<note place="margin">Sixe things in the deſcript.</note> In this deſcription are ſixe diſtinct things: 1.

For the firſt, I call it a ſanctifying grace of the holy Ghoſt in the ſoule.<note place="margin">1 A grace of the Spirit.</note> Vſually wee plant love in the affections and concupiſcible part: But here I plant it in the will of the ſoule, aſcribing to it an higher ſeate, than an appetite or paſſion, as being grounded in the choiſe and purpoſe of the ſoule, &amp; planted by a far ſtronger agent than affections are, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12335:187"/> to an higher end. But of this I ſay the leſſe. That the ſpirit is the workeman of it, appeares by direct Scripture.<note place="margin">Gal. 5, 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> gives it the birthright of all fruits of the Spirit, <hi>The fruites of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, &amp;c.</hi> And the like he ſaith in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places.<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 5.</note> For the Spirit ſhedding the love of God into the barren and hatefull heart of man, cauſeth it to conceive like love to them who are begotten, as that was in him that begat.

Now what that was, his whole life ſhewed: he loved and prayed for his rankeſt enemies, died for thoſe that crucified the Lord of life, converting three thouſand of them at once: hee loved <hi>Mary</hi> and her ſiſter <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> his diſciple moſt deerely.<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.5. &amp; 36.</note> See Acts 2.22. How he went about, doing good even to all, healing diſeaſes, preaching, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting. This Spirit then of the head is derived to us, to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12335:188"/> be a privy marke unto us, whether wee are his or no: for hee that loveth not, is not of God; for God is love,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4, 8. &amp; 16.</note> and hee who loveth, dwelleth in God.

                     <p>Secondly, faith doth purge love from manifold corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: By name from theſe eyeſores.

But love is unpartiall, as well reaching to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving, provoking, as to the amiable (in point of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I meane, though extent may differ) and over-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming evill with good: for the roote of it is an higher
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12335:189"/> thing, than ſelfe-love, and drownes all diſtaſtes in him, that forgat all our injuries and died for us.<note place="margin">2 From in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie.</note> Secondly, from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy. Every foole loves in his moode, while the pang laſteth. But as the torrent is ſoone up and ſoone downe: ſo it is with many lovers; they are either as high as the skies, or as low as hell, either men are the beſt with them, or worſt living. Whence is this? from their fickle heart, which wants a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. Love cauſes the ſoule to be firme, conſtant, equall; and if occaſions be offered of any breach,<note place="margin">Gal 4.18. 3 Folly.</note> yet ſoders it up betimes, that they grow not deepe and incurable. So thirdly, from all ſo injudiciouſneſſe, and error. Love is wiſe, imparting it ſelf, as it ſees the Object require: it is not alike to all. There is a falſe and counterfeit love in ſome men, who out of either a weakeneſſe, or formality of curteſie, will impart themſelves to ſuch as they meete with very gently: and a man would thinke this came from a deepe habite of love: But if ye obſerve them, it commeth from a ſlightneſſe and emptineſſe, for they will impart themſelves to all alike: The beſt Divine in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the verieſt Ruffian ſhall ſhare equally in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no difference. They will be liberall to good cauſes, but ſo they will to bad and baſe ends alſo. What a fulſome love is this? What amiableneſſe diſcerne theſe in the object of their love, who can love the hatefull and to be abhorred, as well as the beſt?<note place="margin">4 From weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> Fourthly, from all weakeneſſe and ſuſpiciouſneſſe. There is in ſome tempers a marvellous jealouſneſſe, which makes us ſo conceited, that the leaſt toy, or wry countenance, puts them into a new frame; when as yet the occaſion concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is meere nothing in all the world. Melancholy may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſome ſeede to this ill humour, but pride is the fomenter of it, and ſelfe-love the nurſe. It is enough that theſe men thinke themſelves ſlighted, or wronged: it skills not whether they be or no: conceit affords realneſſe ſufficient. But this love is too rough hewne to couch cloſe in the building of communion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 16.</note> Candor and ingenuouſneſſe of ſpirit, loth to think ill of that which is ſo, (more than needs muſt) but abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it,<note place="margin">5 From ſtreightneſſe.</note> when no cauſe is, and rather ſtriving to interpret all at the beſt, is a more meete ſtone, to lie in this frame. Fiftly, all ſtreightneſſe and (as I may call it) hide-boundneſſe of

Concerning the handling whereof I ſhall not hold the Reader long in the grounds of this grace, as I have done in the former: Becauſe thoſe points which ſerve to the opening of deſire, either concerning Chriſt himſelfe our alſufficient nouriſhment; or elſe the triall of our owne wants: (of both which I have both in the former and in this latter Treatiſe ſpoken) ſhall not here neede any repeated diſcourſe. Onely my method ſhall be this. 1 I will briefely ſpeake a word of the object of this deſire. 2. I will prove the Doctrine. 3. I will make uſe of it ſundry wayes, and therein, if any thing may be added, either for the procuring of, or the triall of the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this deſire, I ſhall mention it, and ſo conclude.</p>
                     <p>Affections are ſtrong and vehement things in their purſuite, and not ſtirred up or provoked in us ſave by objects of great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12335:199"/> and perſwaſion, eſpecially ſpirituall affections require eminent objects to raiſe up &amp; to improve them. Natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy, love, hope, ſorrow, feare, or deſire, muſt have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table objects to quicken them up: otherwiſe they lie flat upon the earth. How much more muſt it needs be ſo here in holy and divine affections, whereunto our nature is leſſe enclined, and the flame (for lacke of daily ſupply of oile and matter to nouriſh them) doth eaſily decay and vaniſh. Sacramentall deſire and longing therefore muſt needs preſuppoſe ſome more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary object, to excite and maintaine it; elſe neither would a carnall heart eaſily riſe to it, nor it a good heart hold appetite and deſire to it long together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The object of deſire is Chriſt</note>Sundry wayes therfore it pleaſes the holy Ghoſt in Scripture to expreſſe this object to the eye of the ſoule. The thing it ſelfe being in ſubſtance one, the Lord Ieſus the nouriſhment of the living ſoule in grace and goodneſſe; yet the eloquence of the Spirit appeares in no argument ſo great as in this one, to wit, the due laying him out in his colors, that the dead ſpirit of man might behold and eſteeme him as an object well deſerving her beſt affections. Hence it is that in the Song of <hi>Salomon</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alluſions taken from carnall objects of deſire,<note place="margin">Much deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

As when he is brought in like an amorous bridegroome of choiſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, beautie, and proportion, and that from head to foot: as if ſome curious <hi>Abſolon</hi> were to be ſeene, in whom from top to toe, there was no blemiſh. His head, lockes, eyes, lips, body, and all his liniments are painted out to us, that it may appeare he is the chiefe of ten thouſand. The like courſe takes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe,<note place="margin">Math. 13. ver. 44, 45.</note> in the Sermons and Parables which paſſed from him; wherein his chiefe drift is to magnifie grace under the name of the kingdome of heaven, meaning nothing elſe ſave the power and efficacie of the Goſpell offring to the ſoule his ſatisfaction and ſanctification, for pardon, and life eternall. And ſometimes he compares himſelf to a pearle of great price, which he who found, ſold all to buy it. Alſo to a Treaſure hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in a field, which ſo affected him that ſaw it, that he bought the field it ſelfe to purchaſe it. Hence alſo it is that both in old and new Teſtament the Lord expreſſes the grace of Chriſt by
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:12335:199"/> the ſimilitudes of all kinds of creatures, which either by their preciouſneſſe or by their uſefulneſſe, doe draw mens affections.<note place="margin">Rev. 3.18.

Not as if theſe were as good as grace: but that hereby the carnall ſoule of man, (of it ſelfe eaſily ſnared with the love of ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (yea meaner) might underſtand, that look what excellency is in al theſe together for the content of our outward appetite, that infinitly much more is in this for ſatisfying of the ſoule: ſith all theſe are uſed but as ſhadowes to diſcover this.</p>

He would have us to know, Chriſtianity is not, making a ſhift to rub through, or ſome covering of our infirmities, ſupply of ſome wants, or clenſing out the ſtaine of ſome odious ſins.

                        <note place="margin">Sacramentall deſire muſt have her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note>To come a little neerer then to our matter in hand, it muſt be ſome eminent object in the Sacrament, which muſt draw the ſoule to it in this Sacramentall deſire. It muſt be more than the eye can ſee, for thats no object of any affection at all, ſcarce ſo much as a naturall appetite. But what is that? Surely that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually which the Elements reſemble naturally, I meane full and compleate nouriſhment. If the ſoule can ſee this, it will draw deſire without queſtion. Now we know that Bread and Wine united, containe in them perfect food, and cheeriſhing to the whole man, that is, to the body and ſpirits of nature. Even ſo Chriſt our nouriſhment in the Sacrament, is comepleately ſo to the ſoule, both for renewed peace and holineſſe. And to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen this, wee may ſee when the holy Ghoſt lights upon Chriſt Sacramentall, he forgets his ordinary ſtile, and riſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unuſuall one;<note place="margin">Pro. 7.1.2.</note> for then, it makes the Father an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great houſekeeper, brings him in as a man that builds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſumptuous houſe upon ſeven hewne Pillers, prepares his fatlings and dainties,<note place="margin">Eſay 25.</note> his wines and ſpices. Nay, then it tels us, that in thoſe dayes the Lord wil make a feaſt in the mountaines,<note place="margin">Luke. 14.</note> a feaſt of all choiſe delicate things, fat meats and wines through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtale and refined. Nay then, it brings him in as a King who is diſpoſed to magnifie himſelfe in the making a feaſt to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at the marriage of his Son. So that looke what is in a feaſt either for quantitie, fulneſſe of diſhes, variety of choiſe, dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or for qualitie, as rareneſſe, pretiouſneſſe, exquiſite dreſſing, muſique, company, ſafetie of things eaten, without feare, either that they make ſurfeit the gueſt, or breed ill bloud. All that is to be applied to the feaſt of the Lord Ieſus our nouriſhment, which God the Father makes to his Church at the Sacrament of the Supper. And yet that is not all; for whereas that may be eaſily thought to come frow the magnificence of the maſter of it; but as for poore wretches, and hunger ſterven ſoules, how
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12335:200"/> ſhould they come neere it? The anſwer is, That onely for ſuch it is prepared, even for beggers, and ſuch as are found among the hedges, and by the high-way ſides, for loſt and forlorne ones; It is the office of Gods hand-maides and Miniſters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, to bring in, yea, by all arguments of perſwaſion to force even ſuch (not the fat, luſty and fed ones) to this feaſt of the King. Now if it be thus, who doubts but a feaſt of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, a feaſt of all delicacies, a Kings feaſt, offered with ſo ſolemne an invitation, yea, threat of contempt, yea, to the moſt unworthy, yea, with ſuch a welcome at the feaſt as this.<note place="margin">Eſay 55.2.</note> Eate good things, and let your ſoules delight themſelves in fatneſſe; I ſay, who can deny, but here is an object of the beſt and moſt earneſt deſire and longing?

                     <p>I come now to the point it ſelfe, and the proofe thereof.<note place="margin">The point it ſelfe.</note> That is this.

As that Courtier told <hi>Alexander,</hi> that hee would appeale from him drunke, to himſelfe ſober; ſo had wee neede to doe when wee feele neither judgement nor affections, tender and open to the Sacrament, (nor perhaps to any thing elſe, either word, or workes, of God) ſhake thy ſelfe before God, and ſay, It is not with me as it hath beene, I have hung zeale and eſteeme of Chriſt, upon the hedge, other matters, have defeated them, of their birthright.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow according to our order prefined, we proceede to adde ſomewhat concerning the worke it ſelfe of receiving:<note place="margin">Of the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> The communicant then having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken due paines for the making himſelfe fit for the Supper, is not there to reſt, but to goe to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh. Now to give the Reader a taſte beforehand of the ſubject matter of this Chapter, let him know it is twofold. The one concerneth the comming unto, the other the due receiving of the Sacrament. For the former, I will by this occaſion ſpeake a little of the neceſſity of comming to the Sacrament, both in generall as it concernes all that are worſhippers, and in ſpeciall, thoſe that are prepared for it. For the latter I ſhall handle it eyther in that due carriage of the receiver towards the whole ordinance, or towards ſome paſſages thereof. For the whole ordinance it ſelfe, the receiver owes a double carriage,<note place="margin">Entry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</note> eyther of commemoration, or of perpetuation: The former being a thankefull rayſing of heart to God the father,<note place="margin">1. Point. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> in praiſe for the Lord Ieſus. The latter being a preſervation of the integrity of this ordinance (by the incorrupt uſe thereof) from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane deviſes. The carriage of the receiver concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome occaſionall paſſages in the Sacrament, is a ſpirituall accommodation of the ſoule, attending ſo to the outward Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall acts there performed, that hee finde himſelfe much quickned in the grace he brought with him, and edified in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that fruit which he lookes to carry away.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt of theſe. The words of the Apoſtle are plaine, So let him come, and eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.<note place="margin">Proofes. 1 Cor. 11.28.</note> Which words are not permiſſive (let him if he will) but impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; let him,<note place="margin">See Treatiſe 1. Cap. 1.</note> I command him upon paine of my wrath and diſpleaſure. But many reaſons there are to proove it alſo. Firſt, who can deny but the Church and ordinances under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are more excellent than thoſe under the Law? Reade theſe Texts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.2. <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 3.5.6. with many
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12335:207"/> more. Now in the old Teſtament we ſee how ſollemne a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is threatned againſt him that in coole blood (having no plea by ſickneſſe, or jorney, and buſineſſe to alledge) ſhould forbeare to keepe the paſſeover;<note place="margin">Numbers 9. Verſe 13.</note> even ſuch a one (ſaith the Lord) ſhall be cut off from his people. Nay it ſeemes that although legall pollutions might hinder ordinary ſervices and ſacrifices, yet the neceſſi y of the Paſſeover,<note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> tooke away the barre of ſuch pollutions: ſo that the touching a dead man, or being in a jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and about common buſineſſe might not infringe it. The Lord by this meane providing for the honor and neceſſity of the Sacrament. How much more neceſſary then are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpel to frequent? And how ſevere a cenſure of excommunication lyes upon the violaters of them?</p>

Can wee conclude ſuch a thing to be needeleſſe, as requires ſuch a coſtly entrance? It might then bee ſayd, Why is this great waſte? No ſurely. So neceſſary a preparation cannot argue a ſlight duty.

If a man were in a ſhip like to bee caſt away, he would ſay, its not neceſſary I keepe my corne or proviſion, but its neceſſary I keepe my life. So heere. Its not neceſſary that we thrive, or live long, or live at all, (for we may be happy without any ſuch) but it is neceſſary wee have the life of grace in our ſoules.

And when they are cut off by mens cenſures for this their contempt, they are content ſo to live and are no whit troubled: a man knowes not whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe or the remedy doe worſe with them. I might compare them to <hi>Caine,</hi> ſave that I ſhould wrong him by ſo unjuſt a compariſon. <hi>Caine</hi> becauſe he had villanouſly and ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defiled the ordinances which <hi>Abel</hi> and he joyned in, was debarred of them and for ever caſt out of Gods preſence: But as curſed as he was, he could lay it to heart,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note> and ſay it was too great for me to beare. But theſe Atheiſts and ſwine are ſo far from that, that they willingly content themſelves to be caſt out, and think it is a good bar to keepe them from that which they are glad to be rid of. If ye aske why they do thus, they ſay, they have buſineſſe to doe, and cannot skill of this new doctrine of Tryall,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12335:208"/> or cannot be reconciled with their enemies. But Oh monſters in the ſhape of men! doth the Lord appoint yee one ordinance to fit yee for another, as the Sabboth to exempt yee from your worke; and the doctrine of tryall, that yee might come bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared, and doe yee picke a quarrell with the one to balke the other? Doe yee turne Gods helpes to lets? Surely yee ſhall pay double for your contempt, both of the meanes and the duty it ſelfe. If a man bid his ſervant goe to worke in his field from morning to night, and he run to the Alehouſe and neglect his labour: when his maſter comes to reckon him, will it be an excuſe for him to ſay, Truly I was taken up ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your houſe and your worke that I neglected it?

                     <p>Oh!

Let them know, that they offend as much in not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, as if they having not tryed themſelves, durſt come. And the Sacrament eſpecially ſerving for the ſupply of our wants: theſe bereave themſelves not onely of the end of tryall, but of the end of the Supper it ſelfe. I warne them therefore to be wiſe and adviſed.

Rather lay hold upon the Lord Ieſus in the day and ſeaſon of his grace, and ſay, Lord, the meanes I have uſed, preparing to the end: let me not (like a foole) take my labour for my paines, but attaine the end of my labour in comming to thy Sacrament, that both my ſoule and body may honour thee together, and both carrie away comfort of thy Promiſe: remembring how fearefull a ſinne it is, to ſeparate the things which thou haſt put together.

The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eternall in the Church.</note> is to laſt, till the worlds end in one part of the Church or other. Popery by their curſed Maſſe, and other heretickes by their devices, for many hundred yeeres together (through Satans enmity) interrupted ſhrewdly the Purity of Chriſt Sacramentall. They brought in a Sacrifice for a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and defiled this ordinance ſo farre, that they quite defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. The Iewes (as hiſtories relate) in deriſion of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and of the Lord Ieſus, were wont every Eaſter, to ſteale a Chriſtian child or ſtripling, and to crucifie him upon a croſſe: all, (as much as in them lay) to deſtroy the true doctrine and Memoriall of Chriſt Sacramentall. Truth is odious to the factors of ſuperſtition: and at this day, what doe Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with ſo baſe termes as the Supper of Proteſtants, calling the Table of the Lord by the name of an Oyſter Board, and the Sacrament by the name of the hereticke ordinary? alleaging that their Altar and Tranſubſtantiation are the only true means to honour Chriſts Sacrifice, which they offer to God for the ſinnes of quicke and dead, but not receive from God as a pledge of forgiveneſſe and holineſſe.

We know how many hundreds in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. 6. 7. and 8. dayes, but more openly in Queene <hi>Maries,</hi> ſuffered in our owne nation for the defence of this cauſe of God: beſides the thouſands of Martyres ſlaine in other Countryes by the Inquiſition and tyranny of Popiſh Biſhops. Neither are we to looke that in any age (till the Kingdome of Chriſt come) this holy ordinance ſhall ever want enemies: who either openly or ſecretly, in part or wholly, will ſeeke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to undermine and obſcure the Purity and honour, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſubſtance of this Sacrament. But all in vaine: for this ſhall ſtand as a braſen Pillar in the midſt of the floud, and ſhall ſurvive all corrupters and enemies: and ſhall be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in her honour and integrity, till the comming of the Lord Ieſus to judgement, when all hereſie ſhall periſh with the breath

We ſee then what a maine charge lies upon every ſound Chriſtian. Though he be no Martyr, yet he is a confeſſor to the truth of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo ſoft as he receives it, according to the ordinance. He holdes out with an hand openly to all that can ſee, the death of Chriſt, till he come: and by his cleaving cloſe to the will of the ordeyner, becomes a witneſſe to Chriſt Sacramentall: bearing downe as with a ſtreame, all popiſh, ſuperſtitious, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh, wil worſhipping enemies of this holy Sacrament.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12335:213"/> they cleave to the rule of Chriſt, and ſtoppe their eares to all Popiſh chapmen in this kind, who if they might be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, in their conſecrated ſtones, Adoration and other cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ceremonies, ſoone would the honour of the Sacrament lye in the duſt. The duty lyes not onely upon the Doctor of the chayre, or the Preacher in the Pulpit, but upon each member of the militant Church, That he ſhew forth the death of the Lord till he come. Keepe the truſt which is repozed in thee, poore as well as rich, unlearned as well as skillfull, baſe as well as honourable. In this thou ſhareſt with the beſt (for kind though not degree) that in thy receiving corruptly or purely, the truth &amp; glory of the Sacrament is either preſerved, or betrayed to the enemies of the death of Chriſt. If a man ſhould betruſt thee at his death with the diſpenſing of his wealth, and menaging of his Orphans, as truely, as if hee were a live to behold: tell me, durſt thou be falſe to a man?

A peece of worke very little regarded by the moſt. But let us know that as ſome part of the Sacrament was entred upon in preparation, ſo, ſome part of it is to be done after the publike action ended. I confeſſe it is counted a ridiculous thing by the moſte to be ſo preciſe, as never to have done: but to goe from Church to chamber, and there finiſh the worke. But to ſuch as make conſcience of other ordinances in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12335:214"/> this will bee more welcome: and no paines will bee thought too great for the attaining of ſo great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

It comes in my mind what is recorded, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. of the Church aſſembled together in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> houſe. They had beene earneſt to God for <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 12.15.</note> in their prayers. It pleaſed God to heare them and breake chaines and priſons by them: And to ſend <hi>Peter</hi> miraculouſly among them, as they deſired. Now when the Damoſell came in and told them it was <hi>Peter,</hi> they told her ſhe was mad: It was an Angell. Whence came this, that they ſhould ſo hardly beleeve that which they had ſo earneſtly prayed for? Surely, becauſe faith is ſuch a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to our ſpirit, even when it is at the beſt, that it ſeemes to bee a grace above us. Carnall reaſon, feare, and diſtruſt are alway upon the latch ready to breake in when we have beene moſt ſpiritually occupied, (how much more then ordinarily) and to buzze into our eares thus: Thus now thou haſt beene buſied, and as thou thinkeſt thou haſt diſcerned that which few have done at the Sacrament: But what if all this thy labour ſhould bee loſt? What if God ſhould doe neither good nor evill? What if for all this, thou ſhalt be no better than if abſent? Oh! Heere then let thy faith ſtill be as attentive to guard thy ſoule as Satan is, with his fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry darts to diſmay thee: be able to quench them by faith: thinke it no ſtrange thing that unbeleefe hath never done aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting thee: but ply thy ſelfe with this ſheild and Armour till thou have frayed away Satan from thee, and recovered thy former part in the promiſe. Say thus, Lord was thy word ſtrong at my going to the Sacrament, and is it weake at my returne? Doſt not thou alway ſpeake the ſame thing? Is there any
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:12335:215"/> ſhaddow of turning in thee? Shall I in the generall, ſay with <hi>Martha,</hi>

Farre bee it from mee Lord thus to bee at a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den loſſe, as if thy promiſe were no bottome ſufficient to cleave to? This is the firſt thing which the Lord lookes for, that thy faith ſhould be as reall as the promiſe: and that thereby thy heart ſhould bee fenced from the feares and diſtempers of carnall ſence and diſtruſt, which elſe will breake in upon thy wanzing heart, and weaken thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Alas! wee ſee nothing, nor heare any voyce from heaven: wee behold the boldneſſe and preſumption of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who after their receiving, are as merry as the beſt: and this troubles a poore ſoule when hee finds ſtaggering, in ſtead thereof. But, diſcourage not thy ſelfe: better is ſome feare where there is a treaſure to loſe, than all mirth, when thy heart is emptie. Onely let this bee thy practiſe.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12335:215"/> ſhall chaſe away my feares, my diſtruſt, my old luſts of covetouſneſſe, and uncharitableneſſe, impatience and the like? Whence is it then that ſtill they dare aſſault mee? The Lord tells thee, this is to try whether thou wilt reſt in the worke wrought, or rely by faith upon the word, that it may be a done deede, as it was a ſpoken word. Give not the Lord over then, caſt not away the confidence, but lot upon the word and ſay, I beleeve it muſt bee ſo Lord, becauſe thou haſt ſayd it: and if any ſhould come and tell me, methinkes you are better, ſince the laſt Sacrament, I ſhould not thinke it ſtrange, but anſwere, you ſay the truth, indeede, I beleeve I am ſo, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it: therefore if I ſhould be but as I was before, I ſhould make the Lord a Lyer, and doe unſpeakeable wrong to him by my unbeleefe. Thus much for the firſt duty.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond duty follweth.<note place="margin">2. Duty, ſurvey of our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in 3 Acts. 1. In caſe of diſapoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> That a Chriſtian after his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, muſt ſurvey the worke and the fruite of it, how hee hath gayned by his receiving, or what he hath loſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly apply himſelfe. And that in theſe three paſſages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Firſt, if he find himſelfe joynted of that fruit which hee looked for, that God hath not aſſiſted him in his attempt, if hee feele, that ſtill his heart is dead and darke, and the ſpirit hardened from reeiving ſuch grace as God offers; then is he not to ſhake off all at 6 and 7, but to looke well about him. He is to conſider, that ſuch a watch word from God is not for nought, the Lord is not wanting uſually to his ordinance altogether. If in ſteede of a melting and broken heart, more cheerefull by the promiſe, more penitent and more watchfull upon the Sacrament he feeles the contrary evils to appeare; ſullennes, looſenes, deadnes, unmercifulnes; then hath he need to conſult and give ſentence. And whereas hypocrites and time-ſerves looke at nothing, ſave how they may diſpatch the worke, and then make account that God is tyed to their girdles, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſtill their corruption feſter and ranker in them ſo much the more; the people of God are impatient of ſuch ſhuffling and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>And they conclude there is a pad in the ſtraw ſtill:<note place="margin">What to doe in that eaſe.</note> there is ſome excommunicate thing hidden in their tent, which they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:12335:216"/> would not caſt out. And therefore, howſoever conſcience was content that they ſhould take ſome paines to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet the cheefe worke was neglected, and therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their perſon is ſtil unaccepted of God (being in his unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) or elſe ſome beloved luſt lyeth glowing at the heart, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene or elſe unpurged out.

The reaſon was, that although the cauſe was good, yet they were unfit to handle it at that time, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being crazed with Idolls. But when they ſaw the root of the malady, they durſt no longer kicke againſt the prickes: but fell ſadly to ſearch out their ſinne by faſting and prayer, to breake their hearts before the Lord, to weepe, repent, and renue covenant. And upon this the Lord altered his courſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and at the third on ſet, gave them the victory. Even ſo muſt it be with theſe. They muſt not give the Lord over in this Sacramentall diſcovery: they muſt bleſſe him unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that hath rather by frowning upon them, and by turning a day of feaſting into a day of ſorrow, ſhewed them their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt condition, than to leave them ſtill hardned in their ſinne! Oh! If thou belong to the Lord, thou canſt not endure ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a countenance of his to be caſt upon thee; but recover his favour by a thorough purging out that venom which defiled thee: yea if ordinary meanes will not ſerve, extraordinary ſhall; of the practice whereof, I have ſpoken in the chapter of repentance, and the triall thereof.</p>

As <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy,</hi> to preſerve that Truſt commited unto him,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> by the laying on of hands: And ſo ſhouldeſt thou take heede leaſt thou looſe, 3 <hi>Iohn verſe</hi> 8. the good things thou haſt laboured for, till thou get a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

But the traveller who carries a round charge about him or behind him, cannot bee ſo merry. He comes not to a place of robbing or hazard, but hee will bee, ſure to have his company heere him, and to have his hand upon his hilts. Oh! he is ſenſible of his money! So is a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: The grace which hee receives from Gods hand, brings with it a jealous heart, leaſt by ſome meanes or other hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it.<note place="margin">Pſal. 128.</note> Bleſſed is he who thus feareth alway, and ſtandeth upon his watch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">2. Care.</note>Secondly care. That is, hee is very ſtudious and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to improove that Talent which hee hath received from the bounty of the Sacrament.<note place="margin">Math. 25, 16, 17,</note> If he finde that faith and her fruits he planted truely, he playes the occupier of theſe Talents. We know a bare man, having gotten a ſtocke together, and borrowing upon uſe dayly, had neede to looke to himſelfe, as knowing all his hope is in his credite, that hee can hold quarter, and keepe dayes of payment. So ought it to be with a Chriſtian; he goes every Sacrament deeper and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12335:217"/> deeper into Gods bookes. That faith, peace, and grace which he meets with at the Sacrament, is as a new borrowed ſumme of the Vſurer. If he come not to the Sacrament for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he knowes he comes for the worſe.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 17.</note> Therefore all his care is, how he may improove this treaſure, and be daily able by his occupying, to keepe credit with God, and to finde favour with him for new receits, as his needes require. The grace of the Sacrament is coſtly and requires good improovement: And except a man walke in the exerciſe thereof more faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fruitfully, the Lord will withdraw his gifts, and come upon his as a hard maſter, who will exact the uttermoſt penny of encreaſe.

Therefore the former chapter might be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient of this. Howbeit becauſe the ſore is deepe, I will dive a little further into the cauſes hereof, both in the worſer ſort, as alſo in the better, touching upon the remedies breefely.<note place="margin">1. The worſer ſort. Cauſes. 1. Inward. 1. Ignorance.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the worſer ſort (for I would have none thinke that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the diſeaſes of all ſorts) I have obſerved ſome cauſes to proceed from inward, ſome from outward reſpects. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inward: firſt one cauſe is the generall ignorance of people. True it is, Popiſh blindneſſe and error is removed, touching the merit, neceſſity and worke wrought: and generally people are free from Bread worſhip: yea they thinke there is ſome excellent thing in the Sacrament; but if ye come to the up ſhot of the matter, namely to demand what a Sacrament is, to what end ordeined, what fruite it affords, and how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; ye may goe (even in Townes duly and well catechiſed) and picke out ſcores yea hundreds of people, who can give no common ſenſible account of this ordinance: But are as blind, about the doctrine of it, as the mole in the earth. What then ſhall be ſayd of ſuch as live in utter darkeneſſe?<note place="margin">Remedy. Hoſ. 4.6.</note> The cure of it is, that theſe underſtand, that as <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith, they periſh for lacke of knowledge, yea ignorance rotteth the heart and maketh it naught, and therefore that they caſt out this bitter roote, and get ſome meaſure of light: and plucke off the cover of darkenes.<note place="margin">Eſay 25. 2. Cauſe. Superſtitions.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A ſecond cauſe, is ſuperſtition; cauſing a ſolemne yea Popiſh over reckoning of the Sacrament, viz. That it is ſo
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:12335:221"/> holy a thing that all muſt not meddle with, fit to be ſhrined up under a Canopy, than brought forth into over ordinary uſe: Alas! few men are worthy to come to ſuch myſteries; It is well for them they have devout hearts, and love them: But as for that wiſedome, faith and charity which is neceſſary to partake them, they come ſhort, and ſo (they doubt) do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who make themſelves skilfuller than they: Therefore they finde enough of it to come at Eaſter, and ſometimes neglect it then alſo. Oh! blinde idiots! The divell hath caſt upon you the oyle of ſuperſtition to burne you up, as hee hath caſt the water of contempt upon the former.<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> But for remedy know. That the Lord loves not extremities: hee will neither admit the deſpiſing ſcorner, nor the ſuperſtitious eſteemer, but count them both guilty. If God allow the Sacrament to his faithfull people in ordinary, thy ſuperſtitious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlineſſe is out of ſeaſon: let reverence bring thee to God, but curſed bee that ſuperſtition which beates thee off.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. Cauſe. Profaneneſſe. 2 Cor. 6.16.</note>A third cauſe is brutiſh profaneneſſe of life. What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is there with Chriſt and <hi>Belial!</hi> Many do ſo debauch their lives with odious drunkenneſſe, coſenage, lying, ſwearing, Sabboth breach, with other abhominations, proclayming their ſinne as <hi>Sodome,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.20.</note> abhorring the light, and maintaining their luſts and pleaſures againſt it: that their hearts are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out as water: and there is no heart left in them to looke after the Sacrament: They tell themſelves in ſecret, That ſuch holy things are not for dogges: Swine more become the trough than the Table:<note place="margin">Matth. 7.6.</note> The Divell alſo takes on and torments them (if they dare looke toward the Sacrament,) and tells them, They have another trade to thrive upon, their whoring, their riot, their roaring, and emptying themſelves into their luſts without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, and ſtabbing all that give them a croſſe word, muſt bee their joy and delight, and in ſtead of all Word and Sacrament. And thus they deſperately goe on ſaying, There is no hope,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> 
                           <hi>Ieremie Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. The remedy is, That they ſubmit to Gods terrours, and ſtoppe their ungodly courſes, and try if the terrours of God can
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:12335:221"/> came them, and bring them into ſome generall compaſſe.</p>
                        <p>A fourth cauſe is, conceit of mens civilitie,<note place="margin">Fourth Cauſe. Conceit of civility being out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> innocencie and good life among men: but voidnes of grace, and being quite eſtranged from the life of Religion. Now, how can ſuch finde any reliſh in the Seale of that Covenant which they regard not? Its enough for them that they keepe their Church, ſhunne the Alehouſe and drunkenneſſe, be no open profane offenders: but they keepe quarter with their owne Idoll, and ſet up that in ſtead of God, his Word and Sacrament, their harmeleſneſſe and curteſie, muſt goe for pay with men, though they be never ſo fulſome in Gods account. I condemne not civilitie, nay I praiſe it: yet the reſting in a principle of our own, ſterves the heart of Gods grace, when a man reſolves there to pitch. Let theſe men learne to be out of all ſavor with themſelves,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> knowing that their excellencie ſtands in a thing which is quite underline of grace, and ſo ſeeke to ſeaſon their ſoules with true underſtanding of their enmitie with God, and care to keepe covenant with him, which onely can make the ſeales ſavorie.</p>
                        <p>Some outward cauſes there are alſo of this: Firſt, the want of the Miniſtery,<note place="margin">2 Externall cauſes. 1 Want of meanes.</note> and meanes of knowledge of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Supper by name. How ſhould Miniſters preach of the Seales that underſtand not the doctrine of Chriſt himſelfe? Nay I mourne to ſpeake it; divers Miniſters neither unlearned, nor unpainefull (in their kind) nor ungodly; yet in point of the Sacrament, doe little acquaint either themſelves or the people with it, almoſt through the yeare, except in a paſſage a farre off.<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> I dare not boaſt my ſelfe, I know well mine owne wants: but if I might draw any to emulation, I durſt ſay, That whereas my poore labours for twelve yeares, were more upon this, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other one point; I am not aſhamed to ſay, I found the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more fruitfull at the end, than all the while. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe many good people there are who mourne for the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Miniſters in this kinde, as much as their owne deprivall of the benefit.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, baſe example. Sinne,<note place="margin">2 Baſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1 Pet. 1.18.</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. goes ſtrong in the ſtreame of tradition. When as in a towne you ſhall have twentie families into which the knowledge and ſavor of the Sacraments never entred: how ſhould it deſcend into their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:12335:222"/> children?<note place="margin">2 King. 17. ult</note> No, But as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> that worſhip which thoſe Samaritans had learned, was continued many hundred yeares after, even till Chriſts time, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. So heere, looke what unſavorineſſe of Sacraments was in the grandfather and father or mother, it deſcends as an inheritance to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> running in the blood as a diſeaſe. The remedy is, that young ones doe withdraw themſelves from ſuch curſed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of profaneneſſe, and ſuffer the word to ſeaſon their hearts more deepely with grace and the love of holy things more deeply, than lewd cuſtome hath leavened them with the contrary.</p>

Much leſſe doe they conſider the ſealing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12335:222"/> power of Sacraments to give the ſoule aſſurance of that which other Ordinances alone cannot.
